"""Name the merged pull requests behind tests that newly fail on main.

main_full_suite.py keeps one issue open while main's full suite is red, but a
red run lists failing jobs, not what broke them, and nobody is told. This
reads a red full-suite run and finds its new failures: app-host tests the
shard ratchet reported as RATCHET_NEW_FAILURE, or xcodebuild listed under
"Failing tests:" in a batch the ratchet does not grade, that are not in the
known-failures catalog and did not fail in the previous full-suite run whose app-host
shards all finished. A failure in a shard that run did not fully grade (a
dedicated lane failed first, or the batch stopped early) is listed as having
no baseline instead. Such a run is only used while the test list and shard
packing are unchanged; otherwise an older, fully graded run is the baseline,
and tests the skipped runs saw failing are not new either.

Each new failure is attributed to the commits between the two runs' head
SHAs, mapped to the pull requests merged into main by those commits. One pull
request in the range is the suspect. With several, each is ranked by whether
its diff reaches the failing test's suite: 2 when it edits the suite
(test_impact.py), 1 when a changed app declaration or string is named by the
suite (reverse_test_impact.py), 0 otherwise. The top score names the
suspects; when every score is 0 the failure is left unattributed rather than
blaming the whole range. A tie lists pull requests labeled merged-unverified
(merge_receipt.py: a judging check was not green when they merged) first.

`report` writes a "New since" markdown section for the tracking issue (read
by main_full_suite.py report --extra-section) and comments once on each
suspect pull request, idempotent through a hidden marker keyed on the pull
request and its failing test set, and once per commit range. A test tied between more than
MAX_PINGED_SUSPECTS pull requests is listed in the issue only. Nothing is
reverted or re-run here.
