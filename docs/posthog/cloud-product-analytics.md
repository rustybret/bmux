# Cloud VM and CodeRouter product analytics (PostHog)

Project: the main cmux project (`244066`), the same project as desktop
`cmux_daily_active`, signed-in web, iOS and Stripe billing events.

Dashboard: **Cloud VMs + CodeRouter (product)**, built and refreshed by
`scripts/posthog-cloud-dashboard.py` in cmuxterm-hq. The daily analytics email
(`scripts/analytics-report.py`) reads the same query catalog
(`scripts/posthog_cloud_metrics.py`) and links to the dashboard.

These events are emitted by the web server. No CLI or Swift client sends them.

## Identity model

| Concept | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `distinct_id` | Stack user id when the request has an authenticated person. |
| `$groups.stack_team` | Stack billing team id, for account-level rollups. |
| person `$set` | `billing_plan` from the plan that authorized a Cloud VM event. |
| person `$set_once` | `cloud_vm_first_created_at` and `cloud_vm_first_attached_at` for Cloud VM lifecycle events. |
| `$lib` | `cmux-web-server` on Cloud VM events sent through `services/analytics/serverEvents.ts`. |

The shared sender accepts only bounded opaque Stack ids (`[A-Za-z0-9_-]`),
trims and bounds all strings, drops free-form metadata, disables IP
geolocation, and gives every event an `$insert_id`. Create and destroy use
`cloud_vm_created:<vm id>` and `cloud_vm_destroyed:<vm id>` so a replay cannot
double count the same machine fact. Other lifecycle rows use a generated
insert id because each row is an action.

There are two machine-id forms and they must not be joined blindly:

* `cloud_vm_*` lifecycle events use the internal `cloud_vms.id` UUID.
* `cloud_vm_request` uses the provider VM id from the URL (`/api/vm/<id>/...`).
  It is a client-facing name and is not the internal UUID.
* CodeRouter uses `coderouter_vm_id`, the internal UUID, when a route token is
  bound to a Cloud VM.

## Cloud VM events

Source: the `cloud_vm_usage_events` ledger. Every workflow writes one row per
lifecycle fact. `services/vms/productAnalytics.ts` decorates the repository,
so the PostHog event is emitted only after the Postgres insert succeeds. A
PostHog failure never changes the workflow, and a failed ledger insert never
creates a product event. Failures remain in `cloud_vm_request` and
`cloud_vm_provision`.

Common properties: `product: cloud_vm`, `ledger_event`, internal `vm_id`,
`provider`, `image_id`, `plan_id`, `billing_team_id`, `schema_version: 1`.

| Event | Ledger row | Extra properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cloud_vm_created` | `vm.created` | `origin` (`create`, `restore`, `fork`, `base`), `image_version`, `image_size`, `memory_mb`, `persistent_home`, `per_machine_home`, `idempotency_key_set` |
| `cloud_vm_destroyed` | `vm.destroyed` | `reason` (`user_request`, `provider_status_cron`, `provider_status_refresh`, `base_open_provider_missing`, or `unknown`), `lifetime_seconds`, `home_volume_deleted` |
| `cloud_vm_attached` | `vm.attach` | `transport`, `invited` |
| `cloud_vm_exec` | `vm.exec` | `exit_code`, `command_length` |
| `cloud_vm_forked` | `vm.forked` | `native`, `idempotency_key_set` |
| `cloud_vm_resumed` | `vm.resumed` | `source` |
| `cloud_vm_snapshot_created` | `vm.snapshot.created` | `named` |
| `cloud_vm_port_opened` | `vm.open_port` | `port` |
| `cloud_vm_base_opened` | `vm.base.opened` | `generation` |
| `cloud_vm_base_reset` | `vm.base.reset` | `generation` |

Request telemetry (`cloud_vm_request`, schema 2, and
`cloud_vm_provision`, schema 3) carries the request machine name, billing
scope, client fields and the `stack_team` group. Paywall and limit failures
(`vm_requires_pro`, `vm_active_limit_exceeded`, `vm_access_requires_pro`,
`vm_create_credits_insufficient`) can therefore be broken down by plan and
team. `approve_cmux_remote_enrollment` is a polled operation: successful
polls do not produce request rows, while failures still do.

The account-deletion destroy row is intentionally not mirrored. The deletion
flow removes the PostHog person before provider teardown; sending a later
user-keyed event would recreate that person. The Postgres ledger remains the
audit source for those destroys.

## CodeRouter events

Source: `services/coderouter/analytics.ts` and
`services/coderouter/requestTelemetry.ts`. The request wrapper emits one
canonical trace for every routed request and links model usage to that trace.

| Event | When | Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$ai_trace` | Every CodeRouter request, after the response | `$ai_trace_id`, `$ai_latency` (seconds), `$ai_http_status`, `$ai_is_error`, `coderouter_request_id`, `coderouter_outcome`, `coderouter_failure_stage`, `coderouter_fault`, `coderouter_provider`, `coderouter_agent`, `coderouter_attempts`, `coderouter_vm_id` when bound, bounded `upstream_account_id` when available, `trace_id` |
| `$ai_span` | Each bounded request step | `$ai_parent_id`, `$ai_span_id`, `$ai_span_name`, `$ai_latency`, `$ai_is_error`, scrubbed `$ai_error`, `upstream_kind`, bounded `upstream_account_id` when available |
| `$ai_generation` | A completion with usable token usage | `$ai_trace_id`, `$ai_parent_id`, `$ai_model`, `$ai_provider`, `$ai_input_tokens`, `$ai_cache_read_input_tokens`, `$ai_output_tokens`, `coderouter_total_tokens`, `coderouter_priced_tokens`, `coderouter_unpriced_tokens`, `coderouter_pricing_version`, `$ai_total_cost_usd` when priced, `$ai_http_status`, `$ai_stream`, `coderouter_vm_id` when bound, bounded `upstream_account_id` when available |
| `coderouter_account_added` / `_removed` | Provider account lifecycle | Closed-schema provider and source fields, plus bounded state flags |
| `coderouter_route_session_issued` / `_revoked` | Route-session lifecycle | No free-form fields |
| `coderouter_claude_upstream_set` / `_removed` | Claude upstream lifecycle | Closed-schema upstream kind and replacement flag |

All CodeRouter events carry `product: coderouter` and the current schema
version. `$ai_trace` with `$ai_is_error: true` replaces the old
`coderouter_request_failed` event. Non-caller failures also produce a
`$exception`; caller errors stay on the trace. The request id is shared with
the ClickHouse route and usage ledger, so a report can join PostHog, Axiom and
ClickHouse without sending prompts, outputs, headers, credentials, emails or
request bodies.

`$ai_total_cost_usd` is a versioned API-equivalent list-price estimate, not
cmux spend. Upstream accounts belong to the user's own subscriptions.

The application no longer writes new CodeRouter events to the former dedicated
project (`549394`). Its old dashboards and environment keys are legacy; remove
the keys only after confirming that no remaining runtime or operator workflow
uses them.

## Query shapes

Cloud active user on a day: any Cloud VM lifecycle event.

```sql
SELECT toStartOfDay(timestamp) AS d, count(DISTINCT distinct_id) AS users
FROM events
WHERE event IN ('cloud_vm_created','cloud_vm_attached','cloud_vm_exec','cloud_vm_forked',
                'cloud_vm_resumed','cloud_vm_snapshot_created','cloud_vm_port_opened',
                'cloud_vm_base_opened','cloud_vm_base_reset')
  AND timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY d ORDER BY d
```

CodeRouter per-user value (30d):

```sql
SELECT distinct_id, count() AS generations,
       sum(properties.$ai_total_cost_usd) AS api_equivalent_usd
FROM events
WHERE event = '$ai_generation'
  AND properties.product = 'coderouter'
  AND distinct_id != 'coderouter-server'
  AND timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY distinct_id ORDER BY api_equivalent_usd DESC LIMIT 25
```

CodeRouter failure rate uses all known-user traces as the denominator, not
only successful generations:

```sql
SELECT toStartOfDay(timestamp) AS d,
       count() AS requests,
       countIf(properties.$ai_is_error = true) AS failed,
       round(100 * countIf(properties.$ai_is_error = true) / max2(1, count()), 1) AS failure_pct
FROM events
WHERE event = '$ai_trace'
  AND properties.product = 'coderouter'
  AND distinct_id != 'coderouter-server'
  AND timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
GROUP BY d ORDER BY d
```

## Enabling outside production

`services/analytics/serverEvents.ts` sends Cloud VM product events only when
`VERCEL_ENV=production` or `CMUX_SERVER_ANALYTICS_FORCE=1`. CodeRouter uses
`VERCEL_ENV=production` or `CODEROUTER_ANALYTICS_FORCE=1`. Test runs do not reach
the PostHog transport unless a test supplies its own fetch implementation.
