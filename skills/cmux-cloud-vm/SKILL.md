description: "Route work to cmux Cloud machines from the plain `cmux vm` CLI (alias `cmux cloud`): route/run/agent pick a machine, `vm tree` and `surface ls` catalog This Mac and cloud surfaces, and open, exec, transfer, workspace, terminal, port, checkpoint, and domain operations share the same app paths. Use when an agent should run builds, tests, servers, desktop/browser tasks, or another agent on a cloud machine, or when the user says \"cloud machine\", \"cloud VM\", \"run it in the cloud\", \"cmux vm\", or \"cmux cloud\"."

# cmux Cloud Machines

Everything cmux Cloud exposes from the CLI, for any coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, or another harness): the agent-only primitives (`route`, `run`, `agent`, `exec`, `push`, `pull`, `wait`, `terminal send|read|wait`) plus every verb the Cloud sidebar has. Host-side operations require the cmux app and a signed-in account (`cmux auth status`, `cmux auth login`); a guest-safe auth/CodeRouter subset is available inside a machine. Bring up WireGuard (`cmux vpn up`) before private VM attach, exec, desktop, or port operations; a published domain is reached through its HTTPS edge and does not require the viewer's tunnel. `cmux vm --help` is the overview and `cmux vm <verb> --help` prints a verb's own options, both offline; [references/commands.md](references/commands.md) is the complete reference and CI keeps it in lockstep with the CLI (`tests/test_cloud_vm_skill_coverage.py`). An agent with no skill loaded can bootstrap itself with `cmux vm prompt`, which installs the app-bundled copy of this skill at `~/.config/cmux/skills/cmux-cloud.md` and prints a kickoff prompt.

**The mission is delegation.** A local agent (you, on the user's Mac) sends work to machines that outlive the laptop: every terminal and agent session lives in the machine's own cmux-tui daemon, so work keeps running with every pane closed and the lid shut, and any signed-in Mac reattaches later through the same addresses. Compose machine workspaces headlessly (as many as the task needs), watch them with `vm tree --json` and `vm terminal read` without opening anything, and surface panes or a `cmux notify` only when the user should look.

**The shortest reliable loop is:** authenticate → inspect limits and routing → run or stage work headlessly → observe with `tree`/`terminal read` → open a pane or share a URL only when there is something useful to show. Ask for confirmation before creating, forking, resetting, or destroying a machine, because those operations consume plan capacity or delete data.

**Treat the installed CLI as the contract.** Read `cmux vm --help` and the
specific `cmux vm <verb> --help` before using a newly added flag, and check the
`In flight` section of the reference only for planning. A tagged app, an older
machine image, and the app's bundled CLI can be on different rollout versions;
if help and this document disagree, follow help and report the discrepancy.

## What a machine is

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Machine** | A persistent cloud VM (`cmux vm ls`); its generated name (for example `brave-otter`) is its id everywhere, while `vm rename` changes only a display label. New machines run terminals, agents, exec, and the desktop as `cmux` (uid 1000, home `/home/cmux`, passwordless sudo). Older machines keep their root layout until recreated; resolve paths from the remote `$HOME`. A machine may sleep when idle and wakes on connect or exec. |
| **Kind** | Every new machine uses the devbox with TigerVNC on `:1`, openbox, the dock, and noVNC on 6901. `--desktop`, `--base`, and `--no-desktop` remain accepted for older scripts; they no longer select different new-machine kinds. Historical `base` machines can still lack a screen. Shells receive the desktop environment, including `DISPLAY=:1`, so `agent-browser`, `xdotool`, and `cua-driver` can drive the screen. |
| **Contents** | The Ubuntu 24.04 devbox supplies node, bun, uv, git, gh, ripgrep, fd, jq, tmux, xdotool, Chrome, and `cua-driver`; Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Pi are installed on the session PATH. If a fresh machine is still bootstrapping, inspect `/tmp/cmux/provision.log`. |
| **Session** | Every machine runs a **cmux-tui remote daemon** with workspaces (`ws_…`) and terminals (`term_…`). A terminal keeps running when the Mac disconnects or its pane closes. |
| **Publication** | `cmux cloud domains publish` maps one VM port to one HTTPS hostname. `personal` allows the owner, `team` allows current members of a selected team, and `public` allows anyone with the URL. |
| **Workspaces** | One machine hosts **many** cmux-tui workspaces: the machine is the big box, workspaces are the desks in it. Make a workspace per task *inside* a machine (`cmux vm workspace new <id> --name <task>`, the machine's ⌘N) — not a machine per task. The Cloud sidebar shows them grouped under the machine's Workspaces group. |
| **Surface** | A terminal, VNC screen, or browser — on This Mac or on a machine — with a stable id `<machine>/<kind>/<key>` (`cmux surface ls --json`). Panes *project* surfaces: `cmux surface open <id>` reuses the pane already showing one or lands it at a pane edge; closing a pane never kills a machine's terminal. |
| **Base** | The one pinned persistent machine per user (`cmux vm base open`; `base reset` mints a new generation and keeps the old VM) — the user's ongoing work. |
| **Pool** | Machines the router provisioned for agent work (labeled `agent-pool` in `vm ls`, membership persisted in `~/.cmuxterm/vm-run-pool.json`). `vm run`/`vm agent` only draft these; any other machine needs `--machine <id>`. |
| **Plan meter** | `cmux vm ls` prints the meter; the cap is whatever the backend sends (`vm ls --json` → `limits.maxActiveVms`; absent = uncapped, printed as `no limit`). The same `limits` object advertises `memoryOptionsMb`; plan tiers change, so read those fields instead of relying on remembered caps or sizes. Where the deployment gates provisioning to paid plans, `vm new`, the first `vm base open`, `base reset`, `fork`, `restore`, and the router's own provisioning answer `vm_requires_pro` with the pricing link on free or unknown plans; a free plan that can provision gets its advertised machine inside a 7-day access window (`limits.freeAccessExpiresAt` — after it, access verbs need a paid plan while list/status/delete keep working). Never delete machines to make room without asking. |
| **Checkpoint / fork** | `vm snapshot` mints a restorable checkpoint, `vm fork` clones a machine for a parallel experiment, `vm restore` brings a snapshot back — where the provider supports it (`vm ls --json` → `capabilities`). |

## Decide: cloud or local?

| Run in the cloud when… | Stay local when… |
|------------------------|------------------|
| Builds/tests take minutes, need Linux, or would hog the user's Mac | The task is a quick edit or read |
| The task needs Linux isolation or a machine the user can watch through panes and port URLs | The user is editing the same files right now |
| You want isolation (a fork per experiment, a throwaway machine) | The repo has uncommitted local-only state you cannot sync |
| You want to fan out: several agents on several machines in parallel | |
| The user said "cloud", "machine", "VM", or `cmux vm route` shows a warm machine for this directory | |

## Fast start — let the router pick

```bash
cmux vm route                                            # which machine this directory would get, and why (--json for scripts)
cmux vm run -- uname -a                                  # routed, executed, exit code passed through
cmux vm run --sync -- bun test                           # push cwd to work/<dir> first, run there
cmux vm run --sync --pull work/app/dist -- bun run build
cmux vm agent --agent claude --sync -- "run the tests and fix failures"   # a detached Claude Code session on the routed machine
cmux vm tree                                             # the surface catalog: This Mac, then every machine → workspaces → ports → VNC displays → terminals
cmux vm open vivid-newt/main/term_2f9c                   # show the human one terminal (reuses its pane if open)
cmux surface open vivid-newt/terminal/term_2f9c --pane pane:2 --left   # any surface, at a pane edge (same drop rules as the sidebar)
cmux cloud domains publish vivid-newt 3000                # public HTTPS hostname, personal access by default
cmux vm resize vivid-newt --disk 40G                      # grow persistent disk (4 GiB steps; never shrinks)
```

Repeat runs from the same directory hit the same machine (sticky binding, 14 days), so synced checkouts and dependencies stay warm. `--new` forces a fresh pool machine; `--machine <id>` pins one. For a machine the router creates, `--size` accepts `4g`, `8g`, `16g`, `24g`, `32g`, `64g`, or raw MB; read `vm ls --json` → `limits.memoryOptionsMb` first because the server advertises the current plan's allowed choices and resolves unsupported requests to its default.

## Picking a machine

1. `cmux vm route` — the router's answer for this directory. If it says it *would provision*, that costs a machine slot: check `cmux vm ls` first (`--provision` creates it now).
2. Ongoing user work → Base (`cmux vm base open`, or `--machine <base-id>`).
3. A new task on a machine you already use → a new **workspace**, not a new machine (`cmux vm workspace new <id> --name <task>`): one machine hosts many workspaces, and that is the intended unit of scale.
4. Hard isolation (a different environment, a risky experiment) → `cmux vm fork <id>` of a warm machine, or `cmux vm new --detach --json` for a new devbox; add `--name <label>`. Choose `--size` from `vm ls --json` → `limits.memoryOptionsMb` (named aliases: `4g`, `8g`, `16g`, `24g`, `32g`, `64g`; raw MB also parses). Never pass `--image` unless you have a specific image id. Then `--machine <id>`, and `cmux vm wait <id> --wake` before the first command.
5. Persistent disk growth → `cmux vm resize <id> --disk <GiB>` after confirming the target and requested capacity. Values are 4–256 GiB in 4 GiB steps; the operation is grow-only, keeps the machine data and identity intact, and can take a provider minute. Run `cmux vm stats <id>` afterward to verify `disk_total_mb`.
6. Never draft the user's own machines without `--machine`, and respect the plan meter.

## Publish a VM port safely

Use the domains namespace when a user needs a stable HTTPS URL. It is separate from `vm open <id> <port>`: the latter is a private, tunnel-only preview, while a publication creates a public edge with an explicit viewer policy.

```bash
# Generated cmux hostname; no customer DNS setup is needed.
cmux cloud domains publish <machine> <port> --json

# See the URL, policy, lifecycle state, and any verification instructions.
cmux cloud domains list

# Custom zone: print the complete DNS checklist, add the records, then retry.
cmux cloud domains verify example.com
cmux cloud domains publish <machine> <port> --domain app.example.com --access team --team <team-id>
cmux cloud domains zones

# Change or remove an existing publication (hostname or id is accepted).
cmux cloud domains access app.example.com public
cmux cloud domains rm app.example.com
```

The custom-domain flow is intentionally two-phase. The first `verify` call creates a pending ownership challenge and prints labelled records: an ownership TXT record, apex and wildcard routing records, and `_acme-challenge` NS delegation. Add those records at the DNS provider, run `verify` again, and wait for the certificate/routing state to become active. A verified zone can serve the apex or one-label children (`example.com` or `app.example.com`); deeper names need a covering zone. Generated cmux names are already reserved and certificate-covered, so they skip verification.

Choose the narrowest access mode: `personal` (the default) for the owner, `team` with a required `--team <id>` for current members of that team, or `public` for anyone holding the URL. `access` changes the policy immediately; it does not create viewer grants. Treat a `public` URL as a credential and do not put it in logs or prompts. Use `--json` when another tool will consume the result; it returns stable publication/domain objects rather than the human DNS table.

## Running work

| Need | Verb |
|------|------|
| One non-interactive command, ~30 s | `cmux vm exec <id> -- <cmd...>` (`--json` → `{stdout, stderr, exit_code}`; wrap shell constructs in `sh -c`) |
| A command with no machine id, minutes long, exit code through | `cmux vm run [--sync] [--pull <path>] [--timeout <s>] -- <cmd...>` |
| A coding agent, detached, reattachable from anywhere | `cmux vm agent --agent <claude\|codex\|opencode\|pi> [--sync] [--no-open] -- "<prompt>"` (flag/subcommand-led args pass through) |
| An interactive program (REPL, TUI, long test run) driven headlessly | `cmux surface new-terminal --machine <id> --no-open -- <cmd>`, then `cmux vm terminal send <id> <term> 'input' --keys enter` → `cmux vm terminal wait <id> <term> --pattern 'pass\|fail' --timeout 300` → `cmux vm terminal read <id> <term>` |
| Files in and out | `cmux vm push <id> ./repo work/repo` / `cmux vm pull <id> work/repo/out.tgz` (SHA-256 verified, 256 MB cap, `.git`/`node_modules` skipped by default) |
| A machine that is asleep or still booting | `cmux vm wait <id> --wake` |

Opening a machine (`cmux vm shell <id>`, `vm new`, `vm base open`, the sidebar) gives a **plain terminal** on it — one terminal in the machine's cmux-tui session attached in a pane like an ssh session; it keeps running if the pane closes and shows up in `cmux vm tree` (reattach with the `cmux vm open <m>/<ws>/<term>` address the `OK` line prints). Use `cmux vm open` or `cmux surface open` for the machine's individual surfaces. Long shell work under `exec` must be backgrounded (see recipes) — never hold a long `exec` open.

## Watching and reporting back

```bash
cmux vm tree <id>                       # live: terminals with title, cwd, agent state, (open: surface)
cmux vm terminal read <id> <term>       # the screen of any machine terminal, without a pane
cmux vm open <id>                       # the machine's shell
cmux vm open <id>/<ws>/<term>           # one terminal as a pane; reuses the pane already showing it
cmux vm workspace open <id> <ws> [--here|--tabs|--pane <p> --left]   # a whole workspace: new local workspace, or into this one
cmux vm open <id>:desktop               # the noVNC screen (new machines; historical shell-only machines have no screen)
cmux vm open <id>:port/3000 [--print]   # URL for an HTTP port on the machine's private address (--print: URL only; needs `cmux vpn up`)
cmux vm workspace rename <id> <ws> <name>   # rename it; `close` keeps its terminals (they detach into the pool), `rm` deletes it AND kills them
cmux vm tab rename <id> <tab> <name>       # rename one exact tab placement; "" clears its custom label
cmux vm terminal rename <id> <term> <name> # rename every tab placement; "" clears every custom label
cmux surface ls --json                  # every surface (local + cloud) with ids, lifecycle, and which panes show it
cmux surface open <resource> [--new] [--pane <p> --left|--right|--up|--down|--tab]   # one open path for all of them
cmux notify --title "Cloud build done" --body "…"
```

The user cannot see inside the machine: print URLs, pull artifacts, or open a pane when there is something to look at, and `cmux notify` for long work. Only share URLs minted by `cmux vm open`; never guess raw provider URLs. A pane showing a machine surface is an ordinary local pane: move, split, reorder, or close it with the local topology verbs (`../cmux/SKILL.md`); the surface catalog follows the pane.

## Workspaces and terminals on a machine

`cmux vm workspace new|open|rename|close|rm` and `cmux vm terminal close|send|read|wait` are the machine's cmux-tui session verbs; ids come from `cmux vm tree`. `workspace rm` is the sidebar's "Close Workspace…" (kills the workspace's terminals); `workspace close` is CLI-only and keeps them running in the Terminals pool. Every sidebar action has a CLI verb over the same socket method — [references/sidebar-parity.md](references/sidebar-parity.md).

## Credentials

Agents started with `vm agent` authenticate inside the machine the way they would locally: their own login under the remote `$HOME` (set up once with `vm exec`; it persists with the machine), or the team's subrouter through `cmux ai-accounts upload` (uploads local credentials so no token is copied onto a machine). Do not put the user's tokens on a machine unless they ask.

## Guest auth and CodeRouter

Start with `cmux self --json` to identify the current machine and `cmux vm ls`
to list the team's live machines. The guest reads those through its VM-bound
TLS edge without a Mac account token. Host lifecycle verbs still run on the Mac;
read the guest's `cmux --help` for the subset its image supports.

Inside a Cloud machine, the guest `cmux` adapter can report route health and run
an agent through the shared CodeRouter without exposing the Mac's Stack session:

```bash
cmux auth status --json
cmux coderouter status --json
cmux coderouter usage
cmux coderouter models
cmux coderouter agent claude "summarize the current checkout"
cmux agent codex "run the tests"
```

These commands describe the machine's daemon, TLS edge, and VM-bound route.
Host account login and upstream credential management remain on the Mac; do not
copy those tokens into a VM. `vm agent` still starts a detached terminal on the
selected machine, while the guest `cmux agent` form runs through CodeRouter.

## Agent policy

- **Prefer `vm route` / `vm run` / `vm agent` over naming machines.** They only draft pool machines; `--machine <id>` is the deliberate way to use another.
- **Reuse before create.** `vm ls`, then an idle machine or Base. Creating machines needs a paid plan and counts against its cap.
- **Stay headless while working** (`--detach`, `--no-open`, `--print`, `terminal send|read|wait`); open panes (`vm open`, `vm tree`'s addresses) to *show* results, and `--focus true` only when the user should be looking.
- **Checkpoint before risky operations** (`vm snapshot`); fork instead of experimenting on a machine the user relies on.
- **Only destroy what you created this session.** `vm rm` and `vm workspace rm` are permanent; `vm base reset` keeps the old VM but the user must ask for it.
- **Read plan limits and sizes from `cmux vm ls` and `--help`, not from memory.**

## Common issues and fixes

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `vm exec` hangs or times out | Exec is capped (~30 s). Background it: `nohup … > /tmp/x.log 2>&1 &`, then poll — or use `vm run`, `vm agent`, or a session terminal driven with `terminal send|wait|read`. |
| `claude`/`codex` not found on a brand-new machine | Provisioning is still running: `cmux vm exec <id> -- tail /tmp/cmux/provision.log`; the agents land in the session PATH (use a login shell). |
| First command after idle is slow | The machine was asleep: `cmux vm wait <id> --wake`. |
| Attach/exec cannot reach any machine | The WireGuard tunnel is down: `cmux vpn up` (state: `cmux vpn status`; needs `brew install wireguard-tools`). Machines have no public ports. |
| `vm tree --json` times out while a link is connecting | Retry without `--refresh` or scope it to `cmux vm tree <id>`; inspect `cmux vm ls --json`/`vm status <id>`, then use `vm exec` or `vm terminal read` directly when you already know the target. |
| `vm route` says it would provision | The pool is empty/busy. Check the plan meter; `--provision` (or `vm run`) creates one. |
| Create fails with `vm_requires_pro` or an active-limit error | Provisioning needs a paid plan (`cmux.com/pricing`), or the plan's machine cap is reached. Report it; let the user upgrade or choose a machine to remove. |
| `vm open <m>/<ws>` says no such workspace | Names are the cmux-tui workspace names; copy the `ws_…` id from `cmux vm tree <m>` (`--refresh` right after a link attach). |
| `vm terminal wait` exits 1 | Timeout (default 30 s; raise `--timeout`) — the error carries the screen tail; `terminal read` shows the whole screen. |
| Pushed a repo but `.git` is missing | `push` skips `.git`, `node_modules`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`, `.DS_Store` by default; `--no-default-excludes`, or ship a `git bundle` (recipes). |
| Push/pull refuses a large payload | 256 MB cap. Clone/download inside the machine instead. |
| Command works in `vm shell` but not `vm exec` | Exec has no TTY/stdin; use non-interactive flags, or `surface new-terminal` + `terminal send|read|wait` for interactive programs. |
| `vm snapshot`/`vm fork` refused | Provider capability (`vm ls --json` → `capabilities`); providers without it hide the sidebar verbs too. |
| `vm ssh` errors | The default provider attaches through the cmux-tui daemon and mints no SSH endpoint; use `exec`, `agent`, or `open`. |
| `cloud domains verify` still says pending | DNS is eventually consistent. Compare the printed record name/type/value exactly, wait for propagation, and rerun `cmux cloud domains verify <domain>`; do not create a second zone for the same name. |
| A publication is not active | `cmux cloud domains list --json` shows `state` and `verification`; custom domains must be verified and certificate-ready before routing activates. Generated domains do not need DNS proof. |
| A viewer is denied | Check the publication's `accessMode`: `personal` requires the owner, `team` requires current membership in the selected team, and `public` is the only unauthenticated mode. Change it deliberately with `cmux cloud domains access`. |
