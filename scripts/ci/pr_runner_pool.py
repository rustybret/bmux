"""Pick the macOS pool a pull request CI run lands on.

ci.yml's `changes` job calls this once per run, and every pull-request macOS
job in the run reads the answer: compile admission, the app-host consumers
that follow it, tests-build-and-lag, the Claude wrapper, CLI pipe and remote
daemon lanes. A run is never split across pools, because the app-host product
only loads under the Xcode that linked it (#14163).

The run takes the first pool in preference order that has headroom:

    vars.CI_PR_POOL_ORDER, comma-separated; by default
      blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26   same macOS and Xcode as the lane, faster
      blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26    vars.MACOS_RUNNER_PR today
      blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15    macOS 15 Xcode (vars.CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_MACOS_15),
                                   the pool and Xcode main's own CI runs on

    headroom = fewer than vars.CI_PR_POOL_MAX_QUEUED jobs queued (default 3)
               and no queued release or nightly job on the pool

When no pool has headroom, the run takes the one with the fewest queued jobs
(the earlier pool on a tie). A pool holding a queued release or nightly job
is never chosen: pull requests must not delay those. Every Blacksmith pool
is sponsored, so cost is not a reason to prefer one.

`vars.CI_PR_POOL_OVERFLOW == '0'` turns this off. Only the labels in POOLS
are accepted, because each one's Xcode pin is known here; a new pool (owned
Mac minis, say) joins POOLS with its Xcode before it can appear in the order.

The queue comes from the queue janitor, which lists every in-flight run's
jobs each sweep and publishes what it saw as the `macos-pool-load` artifact.
Only a copy uploaded by a run on main of this repository counts, so no other
branch can steer the choice. The janitor sweeps every 10 to 30 minutes, so
every pull request run created since the snapshot is replayed through the
same rule first, one job each, filling a pool's idle slots (POOL_CAPACITY
less what is running) before they count as queued, so a burst of pushes
spreads across the pools instead of all taking the one that looked idle. That costs three
API requests (the artifact listing, its download redirect, and one page of
CI runs); listing jobs here would cost one per in-flight run on every push,
out of the GITHUB_TOKEN's shared budget of about 1000 an hour. A snapshot
older than MAX_SNAPSHOT_MINUTES counts as unknown.

A pull request from a fork into manaflow-ai/cmux gets no repository
variables. It follows the settings and lane the janitor copied into the
snapshot (so the kill switch reaches it too), never pins an Xcode (each job
selects the newest SDK 26 Xcode on the pool it lands on, and the product
consumers restate compile admission's empty pin), and only lands on
ephemeral Blacksmith pools.

Anything uncertain keeps today's route: an event other than pull_request, a
lane (MACOS_RUNNER_PR) naming another pool or unset (the documented way back
to the macOS 15 lane), an API error, a missing, stale or malformed snapshot,
or an invalid setting. The script then prints an empty runner, and every
job's own expression resolves exactly as before.
