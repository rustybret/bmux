"""Which owned root runner kept a build of which main commits (warm affinity).

An owned Mac keeps compile admission's DerivedData between jobs
(owned_build_state.py `keep`), so a later admission merging onto the main
commit that build sat on recompiles only its own diff. GitHub hands a
root-label job to any free root runner, though, so that admission usually
lands on another Mac and compiles from a seed instead. ci-macos.yml compile
admission uploads the `owned-warm-keys` artifact on an owned Mac: the output
of `owned_build_state.py warm-keys`,

    {"runner": "<runner name>", "pool": "glaeda-root-std-xcode-26.6",
     "keys": ["<sha12>", "pr-<n>", ...]}

with the kept build's merge base and pull request first, then the mini's
other roots', then the local seeds' on a mini with one root
(owned_build_state.py `warm-keys`).

The queue janitor folds those artifacts into its `macos-pool-load` snapshot
as `warm` (sweep()), and pr_runner_pool.py reads it: when an idle root runner
is warm for a run's merge base, admission's runs-on names that runner's own
static label, `glaeda-runner-<runner name>` (glaeda-cmux-runner gives every
root runner one at install time). Nothing writes a runner label at job time,
so the routing App needs only "Self-hosted runners: Read-only".

    "warm": {"through": <newest artifact id folded>,
             "runners": {"<runner name>": {"keys": ["<sha12>", ...],
                                           "at": "<artifact created_at>"}}}

Each sweep starts from the previous snapshot's `warm` and folds only the
artifacts newer than `through`, oldest first, so a runner's newest admission
replaces what it kept before. Every artifact costs two requests (its run's
jobs, unless the janitor listed them already, and its download), and a sweep
folds at most MAX_NEW. An entry older than MAX_AGE_HOURS is dropped.

The runner is the one the jobs API says ran admission, never the name in the
artifact, which the pull request's own code wrote: an artifact naming another
runner changes nothing, and so does one from a fork's run. A key that is not
12 hex digits or `pr-<n>` is dropped. A wrong key only sends an admission to a Mac whose
build is further away, which compiles as it would elsewhere.

The artifact name is fixed because this repository's unfiltered artifact
listing answers 500; the listing by name works, and admission uploads with
`overwrite: true` so a re-run attempt replaces its run's copy.
