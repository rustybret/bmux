#
# A conformance harness that only ever reports success is worthless, and worse than worthless
# because its output looks like evidence. Every wrong result this project produced came from a
# check whose success condition had a second, cheaper way to become true: stale text on a screen,
# the harness's own echoed command, a half-flushed buffer, its own nonce tag. Reading the code
# cannot rule that out. Only driving each check to both outcomes can.
#
# So this runs the real harness, unmodified, through its own brokered interface, against substitute
# brokers whose behaviour is decided in advance. Each scenario breaks exactly one property, and the
# oracle below states what the harness is supposed to say about it. A scenario whose verdict does
# not move is a check that is not discriminating, and this exits non-zero.
#
# It also asserts coverage: every check must be seen reporting more than one outcome across the
# matrix. A check that says PASS in all eight scenarios has been shown to be inert.
#
# No authentication, no network, no key presses. Runs against a private tmux socket directory and
# never touches the default server.
#
# Usage: scripts/remote-tmux-et-conformance-selftest.sh
# Exit code is the number of oracle mismatches (0 = the harness discriminates everywhere).
