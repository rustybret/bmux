/// Content-true rebase for a gesture's held pixel-scroll position after the
/// row space changed underneath it.

/// A held position is an offset from the top of local scrollback. While the
/// scrollback is below its cap that offset is content-stable, but once the cap
/// is reached every pushed row evicts retained rows from the top and the same
/// offset names newer content. `row_space_revision` changes on eviction, so a
/// revision-mismatched held position must not be re-applied verbatim; falling
/// back to the live viewport is also wrong mid-gesture, because a verified
/// replay may have just reset the live viewport to the bottom.
///
/// This decision is pure so the rebase arithmetic is unit-testable without a
/// Ghostty surface.
