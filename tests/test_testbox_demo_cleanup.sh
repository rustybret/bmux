# Behavior tests for scripts/blacksmith-testbox-demo.sh with fake `blacksmith`,
# `gh` and hq wrapper. No network, no real Testbox.
#  1. A box the wrapper names (TBX=) is stopped and its warmup run is
#     cancelled in every exit path: wrapper failure after TBX=, a wrapper
#     that hangs past the warmup bound, and a later step that fails.
#     Ctrl-C (SIGINT to the demo's process group, as a terminal sends it) or
#     TERM ends a running bounded step at once, stops the box and exits 130
#     or 143; a second Ctrl-C during that cleanup does not abort it.
#  2. Without an hq checkout the demo starts nothing and names the public
#     fallback instead of a personal default path.
