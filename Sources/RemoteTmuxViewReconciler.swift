/// Pure, declarative reconciliation for the remote-tmux multiplexer
/// (`remoteTmux.multiplexer.beta.enabled`).
///
/// On hosts whose `sshd` caps each connection to one concurrent session
/// (`MaxSessions 1`), cmux cannot open a `tmux -CC` control client per remote
/// session. Instead it attaches ONE control client to a hidden, cmux-owned
/// aggregate **view** session and `link-window`s every mirrored session's windows
/// into it, so all workspaces stream over the single allowed connection.
///
/// Correctness here is a *reconciliation*, never a pile of optimistic
/// `link-window` side effects: given the desired set of windows (the union of the
/// mirrored sessions' windows) and the view's actual contents, this computes the
/// minimal, safe set of link/unlink actions. It is intentionally pure (no I/O, no
/// tmux, no SSH) so the whole policy is unit-testable and deterministic.
///
/// Safety invariants (enforced here, verified by tests):
/// - The view's own placeholder window (created with the view session) is never
///   unlinked — unlinking the last window would kill the view session.
/// - Only windows cmux itself linked (`cmuxOwnedWindowIds`) are ever unlinked. A
///   window cmux did not link (e.g. one a user manually put in the view) is left
///   untouched — cmux never mutates state it does not own.
/// - Output is sorted so a given (desired, actual) pair always yields the same
///   command order (testable, and stable for logging).
