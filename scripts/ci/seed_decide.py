"""Decide whether this main push must build a DerivedData seed.

    seed_decide.py --repository OWNER/REPO --xcode XCODE_APP [--github-output PATH]

A push may skip the Mac only when a seed with its exact build inputs already
exists, because pull requests then adopt that seed by prefix. Comparing with
the parent commit alone assumed the parent had a seed. It often had none:
seed-derived-data.yml never cancels a running seed, so a newer push replaces
the pending run, and the replaced commit is never built. The next push that
changed nothing but docs then skipped too, and main's newest seed stayed on an
older build for as long as such pushes kept arriving. On 2026-09-24, 8 of 22
skips left main 2 to 6 commits past its newest seed with different inputs,
including 80 minutes after #14241 merged.

So walk main's first-parent history to the nearest commit whose seeder run
saved a seed, and skip only if that commit's build inputs equal this one's. Anything unknown (API errors, no seeded ancestor
within the window, a commit outside the shallow checkout) builds.
