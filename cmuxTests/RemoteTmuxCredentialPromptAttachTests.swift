/// check never fired, each for a reason these tests now pin:
///
/// - the pre-control buffer only filled while reconnecting, so on a first attach it was always empty;
/// - `feed` emits on a newline, so a bare `Passcode: ` sat in the parser and was never delivered;
/// - by the time a caller gave up waiting the connection was already gone, so asking it what happened
///   returned nothing.
