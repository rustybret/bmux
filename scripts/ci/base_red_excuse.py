"""Excuse a red check that fails the same way on the base branch.

Run via scripts/gh-merge-green before it refuses a red cmux-next run or a red
required check. A failed job on the PR head is excused only when the same job
of the same workflow, on the latest completed run of the base branch that has
a verdict, also failed, and the head's failed steps and failing test names are
all among the base's. Error lines are compared only when no test failed (a
compile error, say), and warnings never are: they vary run to run (SwiftPM's
cache warnings refused #18147 on 2026-10-07). Names are compared, not counts:
the base may fail more. A runner refusal (no steps, a failed setup step, or the glaeda
hook's refusal), a cancelled or timed-out job, and a failure with no test or
error line to compare are never excused. One base red then no longer freezes
every pull request into that base (2026-10-07: four base reds, and the PRs
fixing them deadlocked on each other's reds).
