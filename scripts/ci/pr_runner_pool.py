"""Pick the macOS pool a pull request CI run lands on.

ci.yml's `changes` job calls this once per run, and every pull-request macOS
job in the run reads the answer: compile admission, the app-host consumers
that follow it, tests-build-and-lag, the Claude wrapper, CLI pipe and remote
daemon lanes. A run is never split across pools, because the app-host product
only loads under the Xcode that linked it (#14163).

The run takes the first pool in preference order that has headroom:

    vars.CI_PR_POOL_ORDER, comma-separated; by default
      blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26   same macOS and Xcode as the lane, faster
      blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26    vars.MACOS_RUNNER_PR today
      blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15    macOS 15 Xcode (vars.CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_MACOS_15),
                                   the pool and Xcode main's own CI runs on

    headroom = fewer than vars.CI_PR_POOL_MAX_QUEUED jobs queued (default 3)
               and no queued release or nightly job on the pool

When no pool has headroom, the run takes the one with the fewest queued jobs
(the earlier pool on a tie). The macOS 15 pool has no DerivedData seed for
its Xcode, so it counts COLD_QUEUE_PENALTY more queued jobs than it has: it
never has headroom, and is the fallback only when the macOS 26 pools are
queued that much deeper. A pool holding a queued release or nightly job
is never chosen: pull requests must not delay those. Every Blacksmith pool
is sponsored, so cost is not a reason to prefer one.

`vars.CI_PR_POOL_OVERFLOW == '0'` turns this off. Only the labels in POOLS
are accepted, because each one's Xcode pin is known here.

Owned Macs (fleet RFC, cmuxterm-hq#573) join as class pools keyed by the
label glaeda issues, `glaeda-<class>-xcode-<version>`. glaeda puts that label
only on a dedicated member whose Xcode at the pinned path reports the pinned
build, so the one label carries the class, the availability and the Xcode.
The version follows the pull-request lane's pin (vars.CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_PR,
`/Applications/Xcode_26.6.app` -> `glaeda-std-xcode-26.6`), so moving the
pin moves the pool, and no runner carries the new label until glaeda has
verified the new Xcode on it. Owned pools are persistent: the machine
outlives the job. They take part only when `vars.CI_PR_POOL_OWNED == '1'`,
and then go first in the default order so Blacksmith is overflow. Their
capacity is the number of machines the fleet manifest gives each label,
published as vars.CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS (JSON, `{"glaeda-std-xcode-26.6": 12}`).
The janitor's snapshot counts the jobs queued and running on each owned label
from the job listings it already makes, and `committed`: what the runs
holding the pool need at their peak, read from the marker each one uploads
(`macos-pool-persistent-<run>-<attempt>-<jobs>-<pool>`), so a run whose later
jobs do not exist yet still counts them. No token beyond GITHUB_TOKEN is
needed. A run takes an owned pool only when its own peak (run_jobs) is free
at once. An owned pool is skipped when it has no slot count, or when the
snapshot is older than OWNED_MAX_AGE_MINUTES. An offline machine still counts
as a slot; what that gets wrong, ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml catches: a run whose
job waits on an owned pool past its budget is re-run on Blacksmith. A re-run
of failed jobs reuses this run's outputs, so a persistent choice also names
`retry_runner`, the Blacksmith pool every macOS job takes from attempt 2 on. The owned order is `std` (48 GB minis),
then `light` (16 GB), then the Blacksmith pools: one order for every job type.

The queue comes from the queue janitor, which lists every in-flight run's
jobs each sweep and publishes what it saw as the `macos-pool-load` artifact.
Only a copy uploaded by a run on main of this repository counts, so no other
branch can steer the choice. The janitor sweeps every 10 to 30 minutes, so
every pull request run created since the snapshot is replayed through the
same rule first, one job each, filling a pool's idle slots (POOL_CAPACITY
less what is running) before they count as queued, so a burst of pushes
spreads across the pools instead of all taking the one that looked idle. That costs three
API requests (the artifact listing, its download redirect, and one page of
CI runs); listing jobs here would cost one per in-flight run on every push,
out of the GITHUB_TOKEN's shared budget of about 1000 an hour. A snapshot
older than MAX_SNAPSHOT_MINUTES counts as unknown.

A pull request from a fork into manaflow-ai/cmux gets no repository
variables. It follows the settings and lane the janitor copied into the
snapshot (so the kill switch reaches it too), never pins an Xcode (each job
selects the newest SDK 26 Xcode on the pool it lands on, and the product
consumers restate compile admission's empty pin), and only lands on
ephemeral Blacksmith pools.

A retry attempt (GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT above 1) never takes a persistent pool
either. A job queued on a persistent pool waits for it however long it stays
busy, so owned_pool_rescue.py cancels such a run and re-runs it, and the
re-run has to land somewhere with capacity. A rerun after a job failed on an
owned Mac lands on Blacksmith for the same reason. The `persistent` output
tells ci.yml to publish the marker the rescue watcher looks for.

Anything uncertain keeps today's route: an event other than pull_request, a
lane (MACOS_RUNNER_PR) naming another pool or unset (the documented way back
to the macOS 15 lane), an API error, a missing, stale or malformed snapshot,
or an invalid setting. The script then prints an empty runner, and every
job's own expression resolves exactly as before.
