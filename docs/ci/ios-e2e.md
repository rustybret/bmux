# iOS E2E gate

[.github/workflows/ios-e2e.yml](../../.github/workflows/ios-e2e.yml) proves
the whole Mac-to-iPhone product path on a pull request: a real Mac app on one
runner, a real iOS simulator app on another, the dev web backend on the
durable tailnet VM, then sign-in → pairing → an Iroh connection → a scripted
streamed terminal session. The per-step driver contract and the regression
each step covers live in [scripts/e2e/README.md](../../scripts/e2e/README.md).

          iOS ⇄ Mac terminal data itself flows over IROH
          (relay or direct), never over the tailnet — the
          ACL below makes the shortcut impossible.
```

## Job graph

| Job | Runner | Timeout | Does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `route` | Linux (`blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404`) | 5m | Sets `run_e2e=true` for manual dispatch; pull-request runs are skipped, with a backend tag selected for dispatch. |
| `backend` | Linux | 10m | Joins the tailnet (`tailscale/github-action@v4`, tag:ci), pings the backend host, ensures the tagged stack (stub; real call is cmuxterm-hq `scripts/dev-backend.sh url --tag <tag>` over SSH). |
| `mac-host` | macOS (`MACOS_RUNNER_PR` or `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26`) | 45m | Downloads the prebuilt Mac app (reuse pending), joins the tailnet under the deterministic name `cmux-e2e-mac-<run_id>`, launches signed into the CI Stack account, advertises through the backend, waits on `/tmp/e2e-done-<run_id>` (bounded ~25m). |
| `ios-e2e` | macOS (`MACOS_RUNNER_IOS` fallback chain) | 45m | Downloads the sim app product (pending), boots a fresh per-run simulator, runs `scripts/e2e/ios-e2e-run.sh`, then ALWAYS signals the Mac's done-file over Tailscale SSH, uploads evidence, deletes the sim. |
| `ios-e2e-status` | Linux | 5m | `if: always()` aggregate; the only check to require. |

`mac-host` and `ios-e2e` both need only `backend` and run in parallel: the
sim's sign-in/pair sequence retries until the Mac is advertised, so
serializing them would just add queue time.

Teardown is a local done-file touched over Tailscale SSH, never GitHub API
polling from the Mac's wait loop: a ~25-minute per-PR status poll would draw
down the repo-wide API rate limit every workflow shares, and the file needs
no token on the Mac.

`ios-e2e-status` semantics: green when the route skipped the lane or every
needed job passed; red when the route said run and any needed job failed, was
cancelled, or was skipped unexpectedly; neutral-skip green on fork PRs (the
secret-fenced jobs cannot run there). It writes the route decision and each
job's result to the step summary.

## Secrets

| Secret | Jobs | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TS_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `TS_OAUTH_SECRET` | backend, mac-host, ios-e2e | Tailnet OAuth join, tag:ci. |
| `CMUX_DOGFOOD_STACK_EMAIL` / `CMUX_DOGFOOD_STACK_PASSWORD` | mac-host, ios-e2e | Dedicated CI Stack account, same pair as ios-streamed-validate.yml; both ends must resolve one account for pairing's same-account RPC gate. |
| `CMUX_DEV_BACKEND_SSH_KEY` | backend | **Not yet provisioned.** Deploy key for the VM's dev-backend control API, needed by the real ensure call. |

Secrets travel only through step environments, never argv, never echoed.
Every secret-mounting job is fenced with
`github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository`, because
a fork PR controls the workflow file's own content; the aggregate reports
forks as a neutral skip instead of a red.

## Tailscale ACL requirements

- `tag:ci` → `cmux-dev-backend-1.tail137216.ts.net` on 443 (Tailscale Serve
  web API for sign-in/pairing/advertise) and 22 (dev-backend control SSH,
  once the ensure call lands).
- `tag:ci` → `tag:ci` on port 22 ONLY (Tailscale SSH, for the done-file
  signal), with an SSH rule mapping to the runner login user.

The narrowness of the second rule is load-bearing: if runners could reach
each other on arbitrary ports, Iroh's path probing could discover the
runners' Tailscale IPs and carry the terminal stream host-to-host over the
tailnet. The run would go green while testing a transport path no customer
has, which is exactly the false confidence this lane exists to eliminate.
Port 22 alone is useless to Iroh and sufficient for one `touch`.

## Infra-preflight failure labeling

Steps that can only fail for infrastructure reasons — tailnet join, backend
ping/ensure, product downloads, simulator boot, the teardown signal — emit
errors prefixed `[infra-preflight]`. Triage rule: an `[infra-preflight]` red
is a fleet/ACL/cache problem for CI infra, never a product regression, and it
does not count against the lane's flake budget during shadow. A red with no
`[infra-preflight]` marker is the E2E itself and gets a
`E2E FAIL step=<id>` line naming the failed step
(see [scripts/e2e/README.md](../../scripts/e2e/README.md)).

## Promotion plan

1. **Shadow.** The workflow runs on manual dispatch while pull-request runs are skipped, and
   on dispatch. Expected red until the TODOs land, in this order: real
   router via `scripts/ci/detect_ci_change_areas.py`; backend ensure with
   `CMUX_DEV_BACKEND_SSH_KEY`; Mac app product reuse
   (`scripts/ci/reuse_app_host_products.py` consumer path); iOS sim product
   reuse (test-ios.yml's `ios-test-product-*` artifact); the two driver
   scripts. During shadow, track pass rate and `[infra-preflight]` rate
   separately.
2. **Required inside the ios aggregate.** Once the lane holds a stable pass
   rate with infra-preflight reds at fleet-noise level, `ios-e2e-status`
   joins the required iOS aggregate check rather than becoming its own
   branch-protection entry, keeping one required conclusion per area. The
   neutral-skip semantics (route skip, fork PRs) already match what a
   required check needs.

Dictionary: **aggregate** — the single always-run job whose conclusion
branch protection requires on behalf of a lane's many conditional jobs;
**shadow** — running a check on every PR without requiring it, to measure
reliability before it can block merges; **done-file** — the local file whose
appearance releases the Mac host's bounded wait, our GitHub-API-free
teardown handshake; **infra-preflight** — a labeled failure in environment
setup (tailnet, cache, backend, simulator) as opposed to the product path
under test.
