// The Freestyle driver, on the public platform (api.freestyle.sh /v5, SDK
// freestyle@0.2.x). This is the only Freestyle arm: the legacy 0.1.x platform
// (SSH gateway, cmuxd-remote WebSocket PTY on 7777) has been removed,
// so every Freestyle machine now attaches the same way every other cmux Cloud
// machine does.
//
// Machines attach through the cmux-tui remote daemon (transport `cmux-remote`,
// docs/cloud-cmux-tui-daemon.md). The API has
// no HTTP ingress proxy to arbitrary VM ports (TLS edge rules need a
// customer-verified domain), so the route addresses the daemon directly.
//
// Every machine joins the one VPC that belongs to its owner, and the owner's
// Mac joins the same VPC over a WireGuard tunnel, so the route is the VM's
// *private* address: `ws://[<vpc ipv6>]:1337/v1/link`. Nothing on that path is
// public — the machine opens no inbound port at all, and a caller with no
// tunnel up simply cannot reach it. Machines created before private networking
// (and any created while CMUX_VM_PRIVATE_NETWORK_ENABLED=0 rolls it back) keep
// the older posture: inbound 1337 open to the Internet and the route pointed at
// the stable public IPv6. Which posture a machine has is read from the machine
// itself, never from the flag, so a rollback cannot strand a machine that is
// already on a network.
//
// The daemon's Noise handshake encrypts and authenticates the session end to
// end either way (carrier TLS is not required and the route token only feeds
// the lease ledger). The daemon must bind dual-stack: the baked systemd unit
// sets CMUX_TUI_REMOTE_WS_BIND=[::]:1337 and the driver re-asserts it on heal —
// which is also what makes a VPC address reachable, since it is neither
// loopback nor the public NIC.
//
// Creates take NO ports field, NO create-time env, and NO systemd injection;
// `firewall` is mandatory. Model-plane env is delivered by writing the
// persisted /root/.config/cmux/model-plane.env file (0600) that
// /etc/cmux/agent-config.sh already sources when the boot env is absent.
//
// Create runs no guest bootstrap. The devbox snapshot carries the pinned
// cmux-tui build and the cmux-tui-daemon systemd unit, and its supervisor
// (services/vms/images/devbox/cmux-devbox-boot) starts the daemon with a
// fresh identity as soon as the machine resumes, keyed on the platform
// instance id. Create is therefore `vms.create`, the grow-only resize, and one
// file write; attach heals a daemon that is not yet, or no longer, listening.
//
// The coderouter model plane is edge-injected: the create carries an inline
// `tls` rule for the coderouter host whose transform adds
// `x-coderouter-route-token` and `x-cmux-vm-id` to every request the guest
// makes there. The platform steers the host to its edge (/etc/hosts) and
// installs its CA at boot; rules added after boot never reach a running
// guest, so the rule must be inline. The env file holds only base URLs and
// placeholder keys: no token is ever written into the guest. Injection
// becomes active 20-30 s after boot, so create ends with a guest-side probe
// of https://<host>/api/coderouter/vm-usage/self (a 200 proves the injected
// token is bound to this machine) and rolls the machine back if it never
// succeeds.
//
// The desktop and forwarded ports (`openPort`) travel the same private path
// as the daemon: the URL is the machine's VPC address, reachable only through
// the owner's tunnel, and the platform is never asked for a public ingress.
// The devbox desktop serves noVNC on 6901 with no VNC-level auth (the
// network is the gate, exactly as it is for the daemon port), so a machine
// that is not on a private network gets no desktop URL at all rather than a
// public one.
