# Checks the things cmux believes about `et`, against `et`.
#
# The ET transport shipped with six defects that shared one cause: its load-bearing claims about
# EternalTerminal lived in a design doc and in comments, and nothing executed them. Unit tests
# could not catch any of them — they assert what cmux builds, which is the model, not what the
# other program does. 77 of them passed while the transport could not carry a stream at all.
#
# So each claim gets one check here. A claim that cannot be written as a check is an assumption,
# and belongs in the PR as one.
#
# Version matters more than usual. ET is not as widely deployed as tmux, and its behaviour does
# move between series: 7.x rewrote the pty input path that 6.x deadlocks on. Run this against
# every version you intend to support and treat a divergence as a finding.
#
# Measured against et 6.2.11+7 and et 7.0.0 (built from source at tag et-v7.0.0), and then
# cross-checked against ET's own source, which settled three things measurement alone left open:
#
#   TerminalClient.cpp        tb.set_buffer(command + "; exit\n")
#   PsuedoUserTerminal.hpp    forkpty(&masterFd, NULL, NULL, NULL)
# The `-c` command really is delivered as terminal INPUT to a login shell on a pty, with `; exit`
# appended, in both series. That is the root of every constraint below. et also has a `--noexit`
# flag that sends `command + "\n"` instead, which would return those 7 bytes to the budget.
#
#   UserTerminalHandler.cpp   6.x: RawSocketUtils::writeAll(masterFd, …)   -- one blocking write
#                             7.x: pendingInput.append(…) then a non-blocking drain
# 7.x rewrote this to stop a large burst blocking its event loop. It did NOT raise the limit: a
# canonical-mode pty still refuses a line past MAX_CANON, so the bound belongs to the line
# discipline rather than to how the server writes, and it is identical across both series. That
# claim used to be an inference here; it is now read from the code.
#
#   TerminalClientMain.cpp    if (!result.count("N")) console.reset(new PsuedoTerminalConsole());
#                             (6.2.11 spelling; 7.0.0 spells it PseudoTerminalConsole)
#   PsuedoTerminalConsole.hpp tcgetattr(0, …); cfmakeraw(…); tcsetattr(0, …)   -- returns unchecked
# So the client does not require a tty, but it does not tolerate its absence by design either: it
# always builds a console unless `-N` is given, and the termios calls simply fail silently on a
# pipe. Control mode still comes up (measured, including with no controlling terminal at all), but
# with no usable termios the client cannot suppress local echo, which is why the same stream is
# far larger without a pty (measured 1324 bytes with vs 44576 without, one session on a loopback
# server). `-N` is not an alternative: it discards the stream entirely.
# The interesting non-difference: 7.x rewrote the pty input path specifically because 6.x
# deadlocks on a large input burst, yet the delivery bound is unchanged. The limit belongs to the
# tty line discipline, not to how the server writes to it, so it survives that rewrite.
#
# THE LENGTH BOUND IS PLATFORM-DEPENDENT, WHICH THIS FILE USED TO GET WRONG. It asserted that a
# 1100-byte command fails, which holds only where MAX_CANON is 1024, as on macOS. On Linux it is
# 4096, so the same assertion fails against a Linux host with nothing actually broken — measured
# there, a 4001-byte command was delivered intact and a 4152-byte one was truncated mid-quote,
# leaving the remote shell on a continuation prompt. The bound is now measured by bisection and
# cross-checked against what the host itself reports, instead of asserted from one platform.
#
# Two further corrections, both real. The DCS position is not fixed: it lands at the start of its
# line on a host whose shell emits a newline before tmux's output, and mid-line on one that does
# not, so it is reported rather than asserted — which is the actual reason cmux's parser must scan
# anywhere. And this script used to create its tmux session on the user's DEFAULT tmux server,
# which it must never touch.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/remote-tmux-et-conformance.sh                      # the et on PATH
#   ET_CLIENT=/path/to/et ET_SERVER=/path/to/etserver \
#     ET_TERMINAL=/path/to/etterminal scripts/remote-tmux-et-conformance.sh
#
#   # The same checks through a wrapper that fronts the client for hosts that are not directly
#   # reachable. The wrapper supplies the endpoint, so no port or terminal path is passed, and its
#   # own flags must precede the destination.
#   TRANSPORT_BROKER=/path/to/broker TRANSPORT_BROKER_ARGS="-et -fallback" \
#     TRANSPORT_HOST=somehost scripts/remote-tmux-et-conformance.sh
#
# The client connects to CMUX_ET_HOST (default `127.0.0.1`), which must be an ssh
# destination this machine can log into, because et bootstraps over ssh before its own
# protocol takes over. The loopback default works wherever this machine runs sshd and
# accepts key auth for the current user; point CMUX_ET_HOST at a different destination
# (an ssh_config alias, another host) when that is not the case.
#
# Exit code is the number of failed checks (0 = every belief holds).
