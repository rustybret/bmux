An owned Mac (a `glaeda-<class>-xcode-<version>` runner, pr_runner_pool.py)
outlives the job, but ci-macos.yml compile admission was written for
ephemeral runners: it restores the SwiftPM cache, downloads and adopts the
nightly DerivedData seed, and compiles into a DerivedData it deleted first.
On cmux11s that was 25 minutes (run 36048804178): 3.7 of cache restore, about
3 of seed, 14 of compile.

This keeps two things under STORE (CMUX_OWNED_STATE_ROOT,
/Users/Shared/cmux-build-fleet/ci by default) instead:

- `derived-data`: the admission DerivedData, stamped with the canonical
  fingerprint (Xcode build, canonical paths, file-system mode). Builds run
  with FileSystemMode=checksum-only (compile-app-host-test-product.sh), but
  swift-driver still decides what to recompile by modification time, so the
  kept DerivedData also carries the input times it was built against (below).
- `source-packages`: the resolved `.ci-source-packages`, so the resolve
  fetches what changed instead of restoring the whole cache. It is not
  handed to the resolve as an exact hit: that would change the Resolve step,
  which is part of the product key (product_input_identity.py). Packages hold
  no absolute build paths, so they live in PACKAGE_STORE, one per Mac, which
  every compile slot shares (STORE is per slot, ci-macos.yml's build-slot).

Neither is ever taken out of the store: `check` and `adopt` hand the job an
APFS clone. A job that is cancelled or fails therefore leaves the last good
state for the next one. When they were moved out instead, a cancelled or
failed admission left its Mac cold, and the next job paid about 190 s of seed
download, up to 240 s of SwiftPM cache restore and often a longer compile
(jobs 107916039092 and 107916686710 on 2026-09-25). The clone costs about
10 s, the same as `keep`'s.

`check` runs before the caches: it drops a DerivedData that grew past
MAX_DERIVED_BYTES and clones the packages into the workspace, where the
resolve step picks them up. A DerivedData stamped for another fingerprint is
not warm but stays: a rerun of an older merge commit (another STATE_VERSION
or recipe) must not throw away the state every current job uses, and the
next successful `keep` replaces it anyway. Its `warm` output tells the
workflow to skip the SwiftPM cache restore and the seed. `adopt` runs where
the seed would: the resolve step has just recreated the DerivedData, so it
clones the kept one in and replays the input times recorded in it, as the
seed's adopt does (seed_derived_data.py). Each job
copies a fresh source tree into the canonical root, so without the replay
every file is newer than the kept build and the whole `cmux` module
recompiles: 2629 SwiftCompile tasks, 386 s, in job 107904138254, against
50 s after a distance-0 seed in job 107906033416. `record` runs just before
the compile on every owned job, warm or seeded, so the DerivedData it keeps
always carries the times that compile saw. It deletes the old record first:
a stale one could age an input back to a time the kept build never saw, and
swift-driver misses a changed file whose time is older. A failed record
means a full rebuild, never a missed one. The record has its own file
(RECORD), never the seed's MANIFEST, and the stamp carries STATE_VERSION, so
a DerivedData kept from a seeded job before `record` existed is dropped
rather than replayed with the seed's times. `keep` runs right after a
successful compile and clones the DerivedData as Xcode left it: the steps
after it stage package frameworks into Build/Products and rewrite the
xctestruns, which a later build must not start from (seed-derived-data.yml
saves its seed before them for the same reason). A failed or cancelled
compile keeps nothing, so the store still holds the state it started from.
`save` runs last, always, and replaces the kept packages with the job's.

A warm Mac is not always the cheapest start. Its kept DerivedData is the
previous pull request's build, so the compile undoes that diff as well as
building this one: warm compiles took 365 to 428 s on 2026-09-25, against 50
to 160 s from a seed a few commits behind. `prefer` runs on a warm Mac when
CI_OWNED_PREFER_SEED is set and says whether the seed should replace the kept
DerivedData. It digests the workspace once and counts the inputs each would
rebuild: those whose content differs from the kept RECORD, and from the
MANIFEST of every seed in this commit's history that this Mac keeps
(seed_derived_data.py CMUX_SEED_LOCAL_CACHE, as many as the disk holds). All are a local
clone, so the one with the fewest changed inputs wins, and the adopt that
follows clones exactly that seed (CMUX_SEED_EXACT). A seed this Mac does not
keep costs a download of about 250 s, worth about DOWNLOAD_INPUTS changed
inputs, so it wins only when GitHub's compare of its commit with the checkout
lists that many fewer files than the kept build changed, at most MAX_DISTANCE
commits back, and only when MAX_DISTANCE is given. A commit count alone says
little: main takes about 25 merges an hour and a seed about 15 minutes, so the
newest seed is usually 5 to 8 commits behind. A start that changes at most
DOWNLOAD_INPUTS inputs never pays for a download, and when the compare bumps
a submodule (the counts no longer compare) only a seed
UNKNOWN_ESTIMATE_DISTANCE commits behind is downloaded. A kept DerivedData
without a record replays nothing and rebuilds the whole `cmux` module, so any
seed beats it. Every error keeps the warm path.

The count alone misleads when a local package's source changed (Packages/,
vendor/, Examples/): every `cmux` file imports those modules and recompiles,
whether 19 or 1,000 inputs changed. On 2026-09-25 three warm jobs cloned a
kept seed 9 to 20 commits behind because it had fewer changed inputs than the
kept DerivedData, and compiled for 533 to 958 s. In two of them the seed sat
behind a package change that a nearer bucket seed had already built (jobs
108004619872, 107981633810). So a start that recompiles the app loses
to one that does not, and when both the kept DerivedData and the kept seed
would, a nearer bucket seed wins at any distance if GitHub's compare of its
commit with the checkout shows no package source change: its download (about
250 s on a mini) costs less than recompiling the app (365 to 1,053 s).

Clones are APFS clones: the canonical root (/private/tmp/cmux-ci) and STORE
sit on the same volume, so nothing is copied. Kept state is replaced by
renaming the new copy into place after the old one is out of the way, so an
interrupted job leaves either the old state, the new one, or none, never one
inside the other. One job at a time touches a slot's STORE, because glaeda
grants a slot's compile token to one job. Two slots can clone PACKAGE_STORE
while one saves; a clone that loses that race is usually a package miss, and
at worst hands the resolve an incomplete checkout that it fetches again. Nothing here uploads anything: a pull request run on an owned Mac never
writes a shared cache or seed, only this Mac's own state, and fork pull
requests never reach an owned pool.
