# Agent workflows on cmux Cloud machines

Recipes for doing the user's work *on* a machine while keeping the user in the loop. All of them assume `cmux auth status` reports signed-in.

## 0. Decide and route (every task starts here)

```bash
cmux vm route --json                  # {machine, created, reason, would_provision}
cmux vm tree                          # what is already running where (terminals, agents, open panes)
```

- Reuse the routed machine when `would_provision` is false — its checkout and deps are warm.
- `would_provision: true` means a new machine slot; check `cmux vm ls` (plan meter, free window) and prefer Base or an idle machine before creating.
- Long-running or interactive work → `vm agent` / a session terminal, not `exec`.

## 1. Cloud dev box from the local repo ("set it up like magic")

```bash
cmux vm run --sync -- bun install                                # --sync runs inside the synced work/<dir>
# idempotent dev server with a workspace-scoped pidfile/log
cmux vm run --sync -- sh -c 'pid=$(cat .cmux-dev.pid 2>/dev/null); if [ -n "$pid" ] && kill -0 "$pid" 2>/dev/null && netstat -tlnp 2>/dev/null | grep -q ":3000 .*[ /]$pid/"; then echo "dev server already up (pid $pid owns :3000)"; else rm -f .cmux-dev.pid .cmux-dev.log; if netstat -tln 2>/dev/null | grep -q ":3000 "; then echo "port 3000 is owned by another process" >&2; exit 1; fi; nohup bun run dev > .cmux-dev.log 2>&1 & echo $! > .cmux-dev.pid; fi'
cmux vm run --sync -- sh -c 'for i in $(seq 1 60); do wget -qO- http://localhost:3000 >/dev/null 2>&1 && exit 0; sleep 1; done; tail -n 20 .cmux-dev.log; exit 1'
id=$(cmux vm route --json | jq -r '.machine')                    # the machine the router bound
cmux vm open "$id":port/3000 --print                             # private-network URL to give the user (resolves only on a Mac with `cmux vpn up`)
```

Sticky binding means every `vm run` from this directory lands on the same machine. The explicit reuse-or-create spelling still works when you want full control:

```bash
# After provisioning is authorized, use the router's recorded pool IDs.
id=$(cmux vm route --provision --json | jq -er '.machine')
cmux vm wait "$id" --wake
cmux vm push "$id" . work/app
cmux vm exec "$id" -- sh -c 'cd work/app && bun install'
```

Finish with `cmux notify --title "Cloud dev server up" --body "<url>"`.

## 2. Hand a task to an agent on the machine

```bash
term=$(cmux vm agent --agent claude --sync --json -- "run the test suite, fix failures, commit on a branch" )
echo "$term" | jq -r '.reattach'                                  # cmux vm open <machine>/<ws>/<term>
cmux vm tree "$(echo "$term" | jq -r '.machine')"                 # [agent claude running] … (open: surface:N)
```

The agent runs as a detached terminal in the machine's cmux-tui session: it keeps going if the pane closes, and `cmux vm open <reattach address>` brings it back (reusing the pane if one already shows it). Fan out by calling `vm agent` once per task with `--machine` pinned to different machines (or forks, §4) and watch them all in `cmux vm tree`.

Inside the machine the agent authenticates like it would locally (its own login, or CodeRouter's env/config under the remote `$HOME`, set once with `vm exec`). Never copy the user's tokens onto a machine unless they ask.

## 2b. Drive an interactive program headlessly (REPL, TUI, watch mode, another agent)

```bash
out=$(cmux surface new-terminal --machine <id> --no-open --json -- sh -lc 'cd "$HOME/work/app" && exec bun test --watch')
term=$(echo "$out" | jq -r '.terminal_id')
cmux vm terminal wait <id> "$term" --pattern 'Waiting for file changes|passed|failed' --timeout 300
cmux vm terminal read <id> "$term"                                # the screen a person would see
cmux vm terminal send <id> "$term" --keys ctrl+c                  # stop it; `send … 'text' --keys enter` types a line
cmux vm terminal close <id> "$term"                               # done with it
```

No pane is attached and no focus moves; a pane the user already has on that terminal shows the same input. `terminal wait` exits 1 on timeout with the screen tail, so branch on it rather than sleeping.

## 3. Repo with history (private repos, no credentials on the machine)

```bash
git bundle create /tmp/repo.bundle --all
cmux vm push <id> /tmp/repo.bundle work/repo.bundle
cmux vm exec <id> -- sh -c 'cd work && git clone repo.bundle app && cd app && git checkout main'
```

Public repos can just clone on the machine: `cmux vm exec <id> -- git clone https://github.com/org/repo work/repo`.

## 4. Builds and tests in the cloud instead of the local Mac

```bash
run=test-$(uuidgen | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' | cut -c1-8)
cmux vm exec <id> -- sh -c "cd work/app && rm -f /tmp/$run.log /tmp/$run.status && nohup sh -c 'make test > /tmp/$run.log 2>&1; echo \$? > /tmp/$run.status.tmp && mv /tmp/$run.status.tmp /tmp/$run.status' >/dev/null 2>&1 &"
cmux vm exec <id> -- sh -c "cat /tmp/$run.status 2>/dev/null || echo running"   # poll; status appears atomically when done
# or skip the pidfile dance: `cmux vm run --machine <id> --timeout 900 -- sh -c 'cd work/app && make test'` blocks up to 15 min and passes the exit code through
cmux vm exec <id> -- tail -n 30 /tmp/$run.log
cmux vm pull <id> work/app/dist ./dist-from-cloud
```

Report the real outcome from the log — a finished poll is not a passed test.

## 5. Parallel experiments with checkpoints and forks

```bash
cmux vm snapshot <id> --name pre-experiment
fork_a=$(cmux vm fork <id> --name try-approach-a --detach --json | jq -r '.id')
fork_b=$(cmux vm fork <id> --name try-approach-b --detach --json | jq -r '.id')
cmux vm agent --agent codex --machine "$fork_a" --no-open -- exec "try approach A in work/app"
cmux vm agent --agent codex --machine "$fork_b" --no-open -- exec "try approach B in work/app"
cmux vm tree                                           # both agents, side by side
```

Delete only the forks you created after the experiment (`cmux vm rm <id>`).

## 6. Desktop and browser tasks

New machines (`cmux vm new`) include TigerVNC with an openbox session and noVNC on 6901; shells get `DISPLAY=:1` while the desktop is up. Drive it from inside the machine (`vm agent` with a computer-use-capable agent — `cua-driver` is preinstalled) and show the human the screen. Historical shell-only machines still have no screen; inspect `vm status` before opening one:

```bash
cmux vm open <id>:desktop              # the screen as a browser pane beside the shell
cmux vm exec <id> -- sh -c 'DISPLAY=:1 xdotool key ctrl+l'   # quick desktop pokes
```

## 6b. Stage a workspace the user opens later ("it just appears")

Group one task's terminals into a named machine workspace, so the whole thing opens with one click of its sidebar row (or one `vm workspace open`) — on this Mac now, or any signed-in Mac after the laptop was closed:

```bash
ws=$(cmux vm workspace new <id> --name pr-4123 --json | jq -r '.remote_workspace_id')
cmux surface new-terminal --machine <id> --remote-workspace "$ws" --no-open --name dev   -- sh -lc 'cd "$HOME/work/app" && exec bun run dev'
cmux surface new-terminal --machine <id> --remote-workspace "$ws" --no-open --name tests -- sh -lc 'cd "$HOME/work/app" && exec bun test --watch'
cmux surface new-terminal --machine <id> --remote-workspace "$ws" --no-open --name agent -- sh -lc 'cd "$HOME/work/app" && exec claude -p "fix the failing tests"'
cmux vm tree <id> --json                          # verify the composition headlessly: terminals, lifecycle, agent state
cmux notify --title "Cloud workspace staged: pr-4123" --body "Open: click the pr-4123 row, or cmux vm workspace open <id> $ws"
```

- The staged workspace lives on the machine. Its terminals keep running with every pane closed and the Mac asleep; opening it later shows one pane per live terminal.
- `vm workspace new` also opens a new **local** workspace as a side effect; when staging for later, close that local workspace — the machine workspace and its terminals stay (closing panes never kills machine terminals).
- `vm agent` cannot target a workspace; when the agent's terminal should live in the staged workspace, start it with `surface new-terminal --remote-workspace` and a login shell (`sh -lc '…'`) as above. A plain `vm agent --machine <id> --no-open` works too — its terminal just lands outside the staged group.
- Watch progress without opening anything: `cmux vm terminal read <id> <term>`, or block on a result with `terminal wait --pattern`.

## 6c. Publish a service for a person to open

Use a domain publication when the result must be reachable over HTTPS outside the
owner's private tunnel. Keep `vm open <id>:port/<n>` for private previews; it is
not a shareable public URL.

```bash
# 1. Confirm the VM and port, then create a generated cmux hostname.
cmux vm status <id>
cmux vm ports <id>
publication=$(cmux cloud domains publish <id> 3000 --access personal --json)
echo "$publication" | jq -r '.publication.url'

# 2. For a custom zone, start/continue verification and follow every record shown.
cmux cloud domains verify example.com
# Add the ownership TXT, apex/wildcard routing, and _acme-challenge NS records,
# wait for DNS propagation, then run the same verify command again.
cmux cloud domains publish <id> 3000 --domain app.example.com --access team --team <team-id>

# 3. Check activation and hand off only the URL and intended policy.
cmux cloud domains list --json | jq '.publications[] | {url,hostname,accessMode,state,verification}'
cmux notify --title "Cloud preview ready" --body "Open the URL from cmux cloud domains list"
```

`personal` is the default and requires the publication owner to sign in; `team`
requires a current member of the selected team and a `--team` id; `public` permits
anyone with the URL. `cmux cloud domains access` changes that policy and `rm`
unpublishes it. A custom zone is verified once and can then serve its apex or a
single-label child; a generated cmux hostname needs no customer DNS records. Do
not paste a public URL into logs or agent prompts unless the user intentionally
chose `public`.

## 7. Showing the human

```bash
cmux vm tree <id>                      # the map: which terminal is which, what is already open
cmux vm open <id>/<ws>/<term>          # one terminal as a pane (reuses an open pane)
cmux vm open <id>                      # shell (+ screen on desktop machines)
cmux vm open <id>:desktop              # the screen
cmux vm open <id>:port/3000            # the app they should look at, as a browser pane (private network; `cmux vpn up`)
cmux vm handoff <id>                   # attach block another human/agent can follow
```

Pair with `cmux notify` so they know why a pane appeared. Prefer `--print`/`--detach`/`--no-open` until the moment you intend the user to look; `vm open` never steals focus unless `--focus true`.

## 8. Cleanup etiquette

- New cmux-created machines normally remain available until explicitly paused or stopped; older/provider-managed machines may sleep. Opening or running a command wakes a sleeper, so leaving one for the user to inspect is fine (say so in your handoff).
- Delete forks and scratch machines you created once their purpose is served; close the workspaces and terminals you opened on a shared machine (`vm terminal close`, `vm workspace rm`).
- Never `vm rm` or `vm base reset` a machine you didn't create without explicit user confirmation — `vm rm` deletes it permanently; `vm base reset` creates a new Base generation and retains the old machine.
