"""Move a pull request CI run off a busy persistent macOS pool.

pr_runner_pool.py puts every macOS job of a run on one pool. When that pool is
owned (a `glaeda-<class>-xcode-<version>` label, pr_runner_pool.persistent),
GitHub never re-routes a queued job: it waits for that pool however long the
pool stays busy. ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml starts this script when a CI run is
requested, from the default branch, with Actions write.

The script waits for ci.yml's `changes` job, which runs the picker. When the
picker chose a persistent pool, that job uploads a marker artifact
(`macos-pool-persistent-<run id>-<attempt>-<jobs>-<pool>`, the jobs and pool
for the janitor's count); no marker means the run is on an
ephemeral pool and the watch ends. Otherwise it watches the run's jobs until the
run finishes. If a job on the persistent pool is still queued with no runner
after the budget (CI_OWNED_POOL_RESCUE_SECONDS, 90 by default), it confirms the
pull request head has not moved, cancels the run, waits for it to finish, and
re-runs it. The re-run is attempt 2, and pr_runner_pool.py never gives a
retry attempt a persistent pool, so every macOS job of the re-run lands on
Blacksmith together. A run is never split
across pools, because app-host products only load under the Xcode that linked
them (#14163); that is why the whole run is re-run, not one job.

An owned runner can also refuse a job it was handed: glaeda's job-started
hook exits 1 when the host is busy (its lock is held), and the job fails
within seconds, before any step of the workflow succeeds. GitHub does not
retry it, so the pull request would stay red until someone re-ran it. A job
on the persistent pool that failed within REFUSAL_SECONDS of starting with no
workflow step succeeded counts as refused: the watcher confirms the head has
not moved, cancels the run if it is still going, and re-runs its failed jobs.
That attempt 2 reuses attempt 1's outputs, so every macOS job in it takes
retry_runner, the Blacksmith pool the picker named, and what already passed
(compile admission, say) is kept. That splits the run across machines, which
is sound only because both sides run the same Xcode: retry_runner is a macOS
26 pool on the lane's pin, the pin the owned label names, and on 2026-09-24
both the minis and Blacksmith's 6vcpu and 12vcpu macOS 26 images reported
Xcode 26.6 build 17F113. If those builds ever differ, re-run the whole run
here instead (rescue with failed_only=False).

A job's wait is measured from the later of its `created_at` and the first
time the watcher saw it queued, so a job record created before its `needs`
were met can never count as already past the budget.

It stops watching, doing nothing, when:
- owned pools are off (CI_PR_POOL_OWNED is not 1), before any API request;
- the run is not attempt 1 of a same-repository pull request run of ci.yml;
- `changes` finished without a marker: the run is on an ephemeral pool;
- the run finished, or the watch limit passed.

Request budget: the GITHUB_TOKEN allows about 1000 requests an hour for the
whole repository. A run on an ephemeral pool costs a jobs listing every
POLL_SECONDS until `changes` finishes (usually two or three) plus one artifact
listing. A run on a persistent pool adds a jobs listing every POLL_SECONDS
while one of its jobs waits for a runner and every IDLE_POLL_SECONDS otherwise,
about 30 in all for an hour-long run. A read that fails is retried
READ_ATTEMPTS times before the watch gives up; a failed cancel or re-run is
never retried.
