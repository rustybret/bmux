"""Carry source mtimes across Testboxes that share the warm target sticky disk.

Cargo decides freshness of workspace crates and build scripts by mtime: a
source newer than the recorded build output is dirty. Every Testbox checks the
repository out fresh, so every source file looks new and the warm target dir
from the sticky disk would rebuild every workspace crate and rerun the Ghostty
zig build anyway.

`record` runs on the box that is about to commit the disk. It writes the git
blob id and mtime of every file under the Cargo-relevant source dirs, and the
entry-list hash and mtime of every directory there (Cargo's
`rerun-if-changed` on a directory compares directory mtimes too), into the
target dir, next to the artifacts those mtimes describe.

`restore` runs on the next box after checkout. A file whose content is
byte-identical to the recorded one, or a directory whose entry names are
identical, gets its recorded mtime back, which is the exact state the
committed artifacts were built against. Anything changed, added, or missing
from the manifest keeps its fresh mtime, so Cargo rebuilds it. Correctness therefore never depends on the manifest: a wrong or
hostile manifest can only make a file look as old as an identical file did.

Both commands also handle CPU-specific build output. ghostty-vt-sys builds
libghostty-vt for zig's native CPU, so a warm target dir written on one
Blacksmith host CPU makes every binary that links it die with SIGILL on
another. `record` stores a CPU fingerprint next to the manifest. `restore`
removes those packages' build and fingerprint dirs when the fingerprint is
missing or different, and Cargo then reruns their build scripts.

The manifest comes from a disk that candidate code wrote, so restore parses it
strictly, touches only regular files inside the repository, and never follows
a symlink.
