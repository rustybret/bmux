# Mac-host side of the iOS e2e gate: launch the tagged Mac app signed into the
# CI account, prove it is answering on its tagged debug socket, then hold the
# runner until the iOS job signals completion by touching CMUX_E2E_DONE_FILE
# over Tailscale SSH. A bounded wait — never GitHub API polling (rate limits) —
# is the teardown contract; if the iOS job dies without signaling, the timeout
# bounds the hold and this job still exits cleanly.
#
# Env contract (scripts/e2e/README.md):
#   CMUX_E2E_TAG                    tag of the app build and backend stack
#   CMUX_E2E_DONE_FILE              path the iOS job touches when finished
#   CMUX_E2E_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS   hold budget after readiness (default 1500)
#   CMUX_DEV_BACKEND_URL            backend stack URL (informational here; the
#                                   app has it baked in from its build)
# Failure phases are named so the workflow can label infra vs product:
#   launch / socket / sign-in / wait-timeout (wait-timeout is NOT a failure).
