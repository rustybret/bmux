# CI runners

Every CI/CD job picks its runner from a repository variable instead of a
hardcoded label. Changing a runner type is a single repository-variable update
that takes effect on the next workflow run.

Linux uses Blacksmith. macOS uses Blacksmith cloud runners. The self-hosted
Tart fleet described below carries specific lanes as they are qualified. WarpBuild is paid overflow and is
not a steady state for any lane. Non-urgent macOS work also uses free
GitHub-hosted runners through the background lane described below.

**The table below is the intended steady state, not a live readout.** Repository
variables drift, and a stale table is worse than no table. For what is actually
set right now:

```sh
gh variable list --repo manaflow-ai/cmux
```

| Variable | Used by | Intended steady state | Fallback baked into the workflow |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `LINUX_RUNNER` | every Linux job (`ci.yml` web/typecheck/db, presence, cloud-vm, nightly/ios decide jobs, claude, homebrew, tmux fuzz) | `blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404` | `blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404` |
| `LINUX_ARM64_RUNNER` | native ARM64 package entrypoint verification | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_15` | the macOS 15 default: `macos-compile-admission`, non-PR `app-host-unit-tests`, nightly helper and test-cache jobs, `iroh-release-gate.yml` streamed validation | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` | **pull-request** macOS jobs in `ci-macos.yml` (the app-host shards and `tests-build-and-lag` follow `macos-compile-admission`), `cli-pipe-regressions.yml`, `terminal-hang-diagnostics.yml`, `ci.yml` (`claude-wrapper`) and `nightly.yml` (`refresh-test-compilation-cache`) | unset (see "Lanes" below) | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` | test-only lanes that pick their Xcode by SDK and sign nothing: `test-e2e.yml`, `test-macos-suite.yml`, `test-ios.yml` (`auto`) and the `iroh-v2.yml` client | unset (see "Lanes" below) | each lane's own variable or Blacksmith label: `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26` for `test-e2e.yml`, `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` for `test-macos-suite.yml`, `MACOS_RUNNER_IOS` for `test-ios.yml` and `iroh-v2.yml` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_DUAL_XCODE` | `swift-package-tests` (SDK 15 release helper, then SDK 26 package tests) on **every** event, pull requests included | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_26` | the macOS 26 image: compatibility jobs, `release.yml` and nightly sign/notarize, the disk-heavy `release-build` universal app, and the nightly compilation-cache warmer | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26` | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_26_LARGE` | the larger macOS 26 machine: changed-revision universal Nightly app builds | `blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26` | `blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_DISPLAY` | macOS GUI, XCUITest, and virtual-display tests (`tests-build-and-lag`) | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_IOS` | the iOS image: simulator tests, TestFlight upload, and `ios-streamed-validate.yml` (`test-ios.yml`, `ios-testflight.yml`) | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26` | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26` |
| `CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW` | the repository-side switch for metered capacity; gates the four paid-overflow variables above (see "Break-glass" below) | unset (free capacity) | unset means the Blacksmith fallback wins |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_BACKGROUND` | non-urgent macOS work only: `build-ghosttykit`, the macOS legs of `cmux-tui-artifacts` (post-merge) and `cmux-tui-nightly` (on demand). See "Background lane" below | unset | `macos-15` (GitHub-hosted, free) |

A runner variable names a **machine capability** — an OS version, a GUI, a
simulator, both SDKs, or a larger instance — and every job needing that
capability reads the same one. It does not name the lane asking, which the
workflow already knows. `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` and `MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` are the
deliberate lane exceptions documented below.

Two capability variables may hold the same label today and still mean different
things. `MACOS_RUNNER_26` and `MACOS_RUNNER_26_LARGE` both name macOS 26,
while the latter requires the larger instance.

The paid-overflow gate and the runner-value policy answer different questions.
`CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW` covers only variables whose purpose is paid overflow.
Other variables, including `MACOS_RUNNER_26`, are checked by
`scripts/ci/runner_label_policy.py` through the CI health report. Gating a free
pool would make repointing it at owned hardware require enabling a flag whose
meaning is permission to spend.

The pull-request lane also has a toolchain variable, set together with
`MACOS_RUNNER_PR`:

| Variable | Used by | Intended steady state | Falls back to |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_PR` | the Xcode pin of the pull-request jobs that *select a pinned Xcode*: `macos-compile-admission`, `app-host-unit-tests`, `tests-build-and-lag`, `cli-pipe-regressions`, the `nightly.yml` cache seed, the owned-Mac producer, and `ci.yml`'s pull-request build-input fingerprint | unset (see "Lanes" below) | `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_MACOS_15` |

Not every job on the pool reads it. `ci.yml`'s `claude-wrapper` never selects an
Xcode, and the two `terminal-hang-diagnostics.yml` jobs run
`scripts/select-ci-xcode.sh` with no pin of their own, so they take the pool
pin described next.

### Which Xcode a job gets

Every macOS job that uses Xcode runs `scripts/select-ci-xcode.sh`, and
`tests/test_ci_macos_xcode_selection.py` fails when one does not. The script
chooses, in order:

1. the job's own `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP` (the lane variables above), if set;
2. otherwise the version `scripts/ci/xcode-pins.txt` names for the runner's
   macOS major: Xcode 26.3 on macOS 15 and Xcode 26.6 on macOS 26 today.

Either way it stops with one `::error::` when the Xcode is below the major in
`.xcode-version` (26), or when the pinned Xcode is not installed, instead of
building with the image's default. On GitHub's `macos-15` image that default is
Xcode 16.4. When a job's own pin differs from the pool pin, the job still runs
and warns, because jobs on one pool with different Xcodes cannot share
compilation caches or products. To move a pool to a new Xcode, edit its line in
`scripts/ci/xcode-pins.txt` and the matching `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_MACOS_*`
variable together.

The deliberate exceptions are listed with reasons in the guard's `EXEMPT`
table: the Zig-only Ghostty builds, the macOS 14 compatibility lane, and
`relay-tls.yml`'s Xcode 16.2 job.

## Lanes

Not every macOS job follows the same variable, because not every macOS job has
the same cost profile or the same urgency.

- **Required CI on `main`, the merge queue, releases and nightly** follow the
  `MACOS_RUNNER_*` variables above. This is the lane where a slow or queued
  runner blocks a merge or a ship, so it is the lane worth paying for if paid
  capacity is ever warranted.
- **Pull requests on `manaflow-ai/cmux`** resolve through `MACOS_RUNNER_PR`
  first, except the app-host unit-test matrix. Same-repository app-host
  shards are assigned per shard across `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15`,
  `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26`, GitHub-hosted `macos-15`, and GitHub-hosted
  `macos-26`; fork pull requests keep those shards on the Blacksmith 15
  fallback. Other PR jobs still use `MACOS_RUNNER_PR`; unset means the
  Blacksmith fallback. PR runs are cancelled on supersession by design, so
  they are the wrong place to spend elastic paid capacity. A fork uses the
  GitHub-hosted branch described below instead.
- **Test-only lanes** (`test-e2e.yml`, `test-macos-suite.yml`, `test-ios.yml`
  on `auto`, the `iroh-v2.yml` client) resolve through
  `MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` first, and deliberately do **not** follow `MACOS_RUNNER_15`.
  Setting it moves every test lane off a backed-up pool in one edit without
  touching `MACOS_RUNNER_IOS` or `MACOS_RUNNER_26`, which also route release,
  nightly, TestFlight and App Store signing. A GitHub-hosted value (`macos-15`,
  `macos-26`) is checked by each job's first step: the self-hosted fleet also
  carries a `macos-26` label, so a job that lands anywhere but GitHub-hosted
  capacity fails before checkout. `app-host-test-rerun.yml` does not follow it:
  a rerun must build with the exact Xcode the products were compiled with, so it
  stays on the Blacksmith macOS 15 pool it has always resolved to.
  Re-running one test to chase a flake should never reach for paid capacity.
  Both fallbacks stay on Blacksmith for that reason; `test-e2e.yml` falls back
  to macOS 26 because the macOS 15 pool's queue-to-start p90 was 83 min against
  1.0 min on 26, measured over 60 dispatches on 2026-09-22/23.
  `scripts/run-e2e.sh` then sends commits whose SHA ends in an odd hex digit
  to `blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26`, so the two instance sizes are compared on
  real focused-run traffic. It splits only that free default: a
  `MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` value naming any other pool is used unchanged.

### Pull request pool preference

When `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` is `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26`, `ci.yml`'s `changes`
job picks one pool for the whole pull request run with
`scripts/ci/pr_runner_pool.py`, and every pull-request macOS job in the run
reads it: compile admission and its product consumers, `tests-build-and-lag`,
`claude-wrapper`, `cli-pipe-regressions.yml` and `remote-daemon.yml`. A run is
never split across pools, so the app-host product always meets the Xcode that
linked it. The run takes the first pool in `CI_PR_POOL_ORDER` with fewer than
`CI_PR_POOL_MAX_QUEUED` (default 3) jobs queued and no queued release or
nightly job, or else the pool with the fewest queued jobs.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CI_PR_POOL_OVERFLOW` | unset (on) | `0` turns the preference off; every job takes its `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` route |
| `CI_PR_POOL_ORDER` | `blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26,blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26,blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` | preference order; only pools whose Xcode pin `pr_runner_pool.py` knows are accepted, and an unknown label turns the preference off |
| `CI_PR_POOL_MAX_QUEUED` | `3` | a pool has headroom below this many queued macOS jobs |

The two macOS 26 pools share the lane's Xcode. A run on
`blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` builds with `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_MACOS_15`, the pool
and Xcode `main`'s own compile admission uses, and the build-input fingerprint
follows that Xcode. Every Blacksmith pool is sponsored, so cost does not rank
them; the order is speed first.

The queue comes from the queue janitor: each sweep publishes the per-pool demand
it already listed as the `macos-pool-load` artifact, and the `changes` job
reads the newest copy uploaded from `main` of this repository. Pull request
runs created since that sweep and still in flight are replayed through the
same rule first, each
filling a pool's idle slots (about 10 per Blacksmith macOS pool, less what is
running) before it counts as queued, so a burst of pushes spreads across
pools. The whole choice costs three API
requests. A snapshot older than 45 minutes, an API error, or any event other
than `pull_request` keeps today's route. The step summary of `changes` names
the pool, the reason, and the queue it saw.

A fork pull request gets no repository variables, so the janitor copies
`MACOS_RUNNER_PR` and the three settings above into the snapshot and fork runs
follow those: `CI_PR_POOL_OVERFLOW=0` or a lane other than
`blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26` keeps them on the Blacksmith macOS 15 fallback as
before. Fork runs never pin an Xcode (each job selects its pool's newest SDK
26 Xcode) and only use ephemeral `blacksmith-*` pools.

`MACOS_RUNNER_PR` does not move a lane on its own. A runner change and its
Xcode pin still have to agree, because `scripts/select-ci-xcode.sh` exits
non-zero on a pinned path that is absent.

Every job that consumes the compile-admission product runs on
`macos-compile-admission`'s pool and pins its Xcode. `app-host-unit-tests`
reads both from the admission's `runner` and `xcode_app` outputs, so it follows
any routing change there. `tests-build-and-lag` restates the admission's
expressions (paid overflow may move its non-PR runs to `MACOS_RUNNER_DISPLAY`
under the same macOS 15 pin), and `tests/test_ci_change_areas.py` fails when
the two drift apart. The cmuxTests bundle only
loads under the Xcode that linked it: a bundle linked by 26.6 (`macos-26`)
imports Testing.framework symbols 26.3 (`macos-15`) lacks and fails to dlopen
before running a test. `app_host_test_products.py restore` refuses a product
built by a newer Xcode than the job's, naming both, as well as another
revision, architecture or major Xcode. `app-host-test-rerun.yml` runs on the
Blacksmith pool whose macOS matches the source run's compile admission.

For the other pull-request jobs, the pin follows `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` through
`CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_PR`, and the two are set together:

```bash
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_PR --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26
gh variable set CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_PR --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b /Applications/Xcode_26.3.app
```

Unsetting both returns the lane to `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` and Xcode 26.3.

`swift-package-tests` deliberately does **not** resolve through
`MACOS_RUNNER_PR`. It builds the Release Ghostty CLI helper against an
SDK 15 Xcode -- it pins `CMUX_CI_REQUIRED_MACOS_SDK_MAJOR=15` for that step
and then asserts `HELPER_SDK_VERSION == 15.*` -- and only the `macos-15`
image carries an SDK 15 Xcode. That pin dates from Zig 0.15.2, whose MachO
linker could not resolve `libSystem` against an Xcode 26.4+ SDK
(ziglang/zig#31658, fixed by #31673 in Zig 0.16.0); the Ghostty submodule has
required 0.16.0 since 2026-09-17 and `install-zig-ci.sh` reads the version from
that manifest, so the original reason is probably gone. The SDK 15 assertion is
what still holds the job, and it has not been retested on a macos-26 image. So
it stays on `MACOS_RUNNER_DUAL_XCODE` on every event, and the dual-Xcode guard in
`tests/test_ci_self_hosted_guard.sh` fails if it ever reads
`MACOS_RUNNER_PR`.
`test_macos_jobs_use_lane_specific_xcode_pin_vars` in
`tests/test_ci_change_areas.py` keeps the pin on the same escape hatch as the
pool.

The dispatch-only owned-Mac producer in `persistent-macos-compile.yml` reads
`CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_PR` directly, because only pull-request jobs consume its
products and hosted revalidation rejects a toolchain mismatch. Before enabling
`CI_PERSISTENT_MAC_COMPILE`, the owned Mac has to carry whatever Xcode the
pull-request lane currently pins;
`check_persistent_compile_owned_mac_occupancy` in
`tests/test_ci_self_hosted_guard.sh` reduces the hosted job's conditional to its
pull-request branch before comparing, and separately requires the producer to
name the lane directly: that file is `workflow_dispatch`-only, so a conditional
on `github.event_name` there would never take the branch being compared.

`MACOS_RUNNER_PR` and `MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` are escape hatches: leaving them
unset is the intended state, and setting one overrides just that lane without
touching required CI. That makes a rollback a variable edit rather than a
revert.

A job that also reports its own pool in an env value must read that value from
the same expression its `runs-on` uses, not from the lane variable alone.
`macos-compile-admission` puts `CMUX_PRODUCT_RUNNER` in the compiled product
contract and `tests-build-and-lag` validates `REQUESTED_RUNNER`; on a pull
request both resolve through `MACOS_RUNNER_PR`, so a job reading only
`MACOS_RUNNER_15` or `MACOS_RUNNER_DISPLAY` would stamp and check a pool it is
not on. `check_macos_runner_identity_env_tracks_routing` in
`tests/test_ci_self_hosted_guard.sh` enforces that.

Every workflow exercised by a `pull_request` — including local reusable
workflows reached through `workflow_call` — has an explicit repository-owner
branch before runner variables are consulted. On `manaflow-ai/cmux`, existing
repository variables and their Blacksmith fallbacks behave exactly as above. On
every other owner, Linux jobs use `ubuntu-24.04` and macOS jobs use
`macos-26` from GitHub Actions: the image and Xcode (26.6) main compiles with,
so a fork's own CI can hit main's caches, which anyone can read from
`https://ci-cache.cmux.com`. Only the jobs that build the SDK 15 Ghostty CLI
helper (`swift-package-tests`, release and nightly), `plain-paste-worker.yml`'s
`macos-15` job and `ci-macos-compat.yml`'s macOS 15 row keep a `macos-15` fork
branch, because they need that image. Fork jobs set no Xcode pin, so they take
the pool pin from `scripts/ci/xcode-pins.txt` (26.6 on `macos-26`, the Xcode
main compiles with). When a hosted image no longer carries that Xcode, a fork
falls back to the image's newest stable Xcode with a warning, so a newer image
Xcode is a cache miss, never a failure. Runs in `manaflow-ai` fail on a missing
pool Xcode instead. The self-hosted guard allows a literal `macos-26` only in this exact
`github.repository_owner != 'manaflow-ai' && 'macos-26'` form, which evaluates
solely outside `manaflow-ai`, where the fleet's `macos-26` label does not exist.

Scheduled, dispatched and push-only workflows take the same owner branch, so
a fork's own nightly, release, SDK and dispatch runs never wait on Blacksmith
either. Dispatch inputs that default to a Blacksmith label (`reload-build.yml`,
`test-e2e.yml`, `test-ios.yml`, `perf-activation.yml`) are overridden by the
owner branch; `test-e2e.yml` applies it to the pool its runner job picks. The
Blacksmith Testbox warmup has no hosted equivalent, so it is skipped outside
`manaflow-ai`.

That is the fork contract: **a fork needs zero runner variables and zero runner
provider setup to run its workflows.** Blacksmith is an
organization-level GitHub App; naming a `blacksmith-*` label in a personal
fork does not produce a useful error, it leaves the job queued indefinitely.
The fork branch therefore short-circuits before any `MACOS_RUNNER_*` or
`LINUX_RUNNER` value can select organization-only capacity.

`tests/test_ci_fork_runner_routing.py` discovers every `pull_request`
workflow, recursively follows its local reusable-workflow calls, and requires
every variable-routed `runs-on` in that closure to contain a hosted fork
branch. Across every workflow, it also rejects a Blacksmith label that a
zero-configuration run outside `manaflow-ai` could select: each expression
holding one must start with the owner branch, unless the job itself is
owner-gated or the line is allow-listed there with a reason. The upstream branch still keeps literal Blacksmith fallbacks so deleting
a repository variable cannot silently change `manaflow-ai/cmux` capacity.

## Background lane

`MACOS_RUNNER_BACKGROUND` moves macOS work that nobody is waiting on off the
shared macOS pool. Every other macOS job shares one Blacksmith pool (with paid
Warp as overflow), and pull request CI queues on it for 30-60+ minutes at peak.
The repository is public, so standard GitHub-hosted macOS runners are free with
unlimited minutes (about five concurrent jobs, 3-core M1, 7 GB RAM). They are
slower per job, which is fine for work that is not on a merge path.

A job belongs in the lane only if all of these hold:

- it is dispatch-only, scheduled, or runs after merge; never `pull_request`,
  `pull_request_target`, `merge_group`, or `workflow_call` (the guard enforces
  this per workflow);
- it fits 3 cores and 7 GB: scripts, a single package, a Rust or Zig build,
  uploads; not a full app or app-host XCTest build;
- it is not a timing benchmark or incremental-build probe, whose numbers only
  compare on the same hardware;
- it does not need a GUI console session.

Members today: `build-ghosttykit.yml` (Xcode from the image default, Zig
xcframework build), and the two macOS Rust legs of `cmux-tui-artifacts.yml`
and `cmux-tui-nightly.yml` (passed as `macos_runner` to
`cmux-tui-build-package.yml`; release and merge-gate callers keep their own
runner).

The fallback is `macos-15`, never `macos-26`: the self-hosted fleet carries a
`macos-26` label and GitHub prefers a matching self-hosted runner. The
`macos-15` image ships Xcode 26.3 (macOS 26.2 SDK) next to its 16.4 default, so
jobs that pin `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_MACOS_15` resolve there too.

An admin can repoint the whole lane with one variable edit, for example back
to Blacksmith if GitHub's macOS queue is ever the slower one:

```bash
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_BACKGROUND --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15
```

Leaving it unset is the intended state.

## Persistent compile-admission pilot

`macos-compile-admission` has one narrow owned-Mac producer path for trusted,
same-repository maintainer pull requests. The required
`macOS compile admission` job remains on the ordinary paid macOS runner and
remains the check, log, validation, and artifact-publication owner. It may
consume a compile product from `.github/workflows/persistent-macos-compile.yml`
after revalidating the Git revision/tree, Xcode, SDK, architecture,
`Package.resolved`, submodules, Glaeda lineage evidence, warning budget, and
early CLI probes. Any dispatch, queue, execution, download, or validation miss
falls through to the existing hosted compile in that same required job.
The required hosted macOS job is allocated without waiting for the persistent
producer. It restores any exact reusable product first, then observes the
producer with read-only Actions permission before deciding whether to consume
the persistent artifact or compile hosted. That observation is nonblocking:
the producer is consumed only when its compile is already complete at the
decision point; an absent, queued, or running producer falls through to hosted
compilation immediately. The PR workflow never receives
Actions write authority: `changes` publishes a small exact-source request
artifact, and the default-branch `persistent-macos-router.yml` workflow
validates it against the live PR and owns producer dispatch/cancellation.

The producer is `workflow_dispatch`-only and requires the
`cmux-persistent-compile` runner group plus the dedicated
`cmux-persistent-macos-compile` label. Before rollout, the organization-owned
runner group must allow this public repository and restrict workflow access to
`manaflow-ai/cmux/.github/workflows/persistent-macos-compile.yml@refs/heads/main`.
That group policy is the external scheduling boundary: branch-modified workflow
copies cannot acquire the owned Mac. The compile job has empty GitHub-token
permissions, performs public Git fetches instead of `actions/checkout`, and
receives no repository secrets. Glaeda owns DerivedData, SwiftPM,
module-cache, and Xcode compilation-cache persistence; every run still resolves
packages and performs exact source/toolchain admission.

Glaeda performs no automatic cache eviction, and each generation under
`.glaeda/apple-build/cache/<key>/` holds a full cmux DerivedData tree, so a
toolchain change would otherwise strand a multi-GB directory on the owned Mac
indefinitely. After a verified compile, `run-persistent-mac-compile.py` stamps
the generation it used and deletes all but the three most recently used ones,
logging each removal and recording it in the admission metrics. The generation
in use is never a candidate; an evicted generation costs only a cold rebuild.

Capacity sizing for that pilot -- how many owned Macs the queue actually
needs, which lane moves first, and the enrollment/drain/rollback runbook --
lives in [ci/mac-fleet.md](ci/mac-fleet.md).

Rollout is reversible through two repository variables:

- `CI_PERSISTENT_MAC_COMPILE=off` (or unset): hosted path only;
- `CI_PERSISTENT_MAC_COMPILE=pilot` with
  `CI_PERSISTENT_MAC_COMPILE_COHORT=13198,feature/name`: only matching trusted
  PR numbers or head branches;
- `CI_PERSISTENT_MAC_COMPILE=all`: every trusted same-repository
  organization PR (`OWNER` or `MEMBER`).

`OWNER`/`MEMBER` is the single admitted author-association set. The producer's
`authorize` job enforces it, and every routing gate ahead of the producer
(`ci.yml`, `ci-macos.yml`, `scripts/ci/persistent_mac_route.py`) must match it
exactly. A routing gate wider than the producer still fails safe, but it
dispatches a producer that is certain to refuse, which costs an owned-Mac
allocation and reports `producer_failure` instead of falling through to the
hosted path at once. `tests/test_ci_persistent_mac_compile.py` derives all four
sets from their source files and asserts they agree, so they cannot drift.

Queue and execution ceilings may be set with
`CI_PERSISTENT_MAC_QUEUE_SECONDS` and
`CI_PERSISTENT_MAC_EXECUTION_SECONDS`; defaults are 90 and 480 seconds.
Admission publishes timing evidence for source preparation, package readiness,
compile, warning validation, product publication, total wall time, runner time,
and the `hot` / `partially-warm` / `cold-reset` / `hosted fallback`
classification.

## Tart isolation and capacity

Each GitHub runner identity is sealed into a Tart template. A job runs in a
fresh clone with an Aqua login session, then the host deletes the clone. This
provides the GUI session required by macOS XCTest and prevents DerivedData,
simulators, credentials, and workspaces from leaking into later jobs.

The fleet has 18 Sequoia slots: two each on the seven 48 GB or larger hosts and
one each on the two 16 GB hosts. The 16 large-host slots accept GUI and iOS
jobs; all 18 accept ordinary macOS 15 jobs. macOS 26 and release builds stay on
Blacksmith until a Tahoe VM image passes the same runner and GUI canaries. Hosts
reject new jobs below their free-space threshold, delete every job VM after
use, and reap stale clones.

Do not route jobs to the physical mini runner records. The supported
self-hosted labels are the `tart-*` labels, and each Tart-aware canary checks
that the resolved runner name starts with `tart-cmux-` and that the guest has
the immutable `/etc/cmux-tart-ci` marker.

## Shared physical-host interoperability

The current required-CI policy continues to use isolated Tart guests or hosted
providers. Any future path that executes directly on shared CMUX-owned hardware
must preserve a separate caller identity, semantic workload request, and
machine-local physical lease.

Examples of callers that may share a host include GitHub Actions, `cmux-ci`,
developer/build tooling, direct agents, operator commands, and reviewed fleet
schedulers. They keep their own workflow state. The host-side execution adapter
owns fresh admission, resource ownership, bounded execution, and settlement.

A scheduler may select a candidate node. That selection stays advisory until
the node rechecks current drain/pressure/resource state and acquires its local
lease. When the CMUX controller already holds a machine or resource reservation,
the host adapter validates that reservation's owner, scope, generation, and
expiry, then binds local execution to it. It never creates an unrelated
competing reservation for the same resource.

Scarce local claims include native build lanes, heavy Linux slots,
project-native locks, artifact-publisher slots, and resident workspaces.
Participating adapters use one collision boundary for those claims. Runner
liveness, process names, and apparent idleness are observation only.

Execution receipts correlate the caller class and external request reference
with the semantic workload, opaque node identity/class, local lease generation,
result, and cleanup/settlement. Caller-private workflow state remains in the
caller.

Hosted/isolated fallback remains available when the shared host refuses local
admission or is draining, pressured, or unavailable.

## Break-glass: switch a runner type to a paid provider

There is no automatic overflow for the runner variables. If the Tart pool is
unavailable or its queue is too long, set the affected variable to a paid
provider.

The two owned-Mac producer lanes are the exception, because they never own a
result: the persistent compile route and the nightly route
(`scripts/ci/nightly_mini_route.py`) wait a bounded time for a mini and fall
back to the hosted build automatically on a queue timeout, an overrun, a
producer failure or a refused product. Restore Tart after the
fleet recovers.

Four runner variables exist to name **metered WarpBuild capacity**, so they are
read through a second switch that lives in this repository rather than in
repository settings:

| | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW` unset or not `1` | `MACOS_RUNNER_15`, `MACOS_RUNNER_DISPLAY`, `MACOS_RUNNER_DUAL_XCODE` and `MACOS_RUNNER_26_LARGE` are **not read**; every lane takes its free Blacksmith fallback |
| `CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW` = `1` | those four variables select the pool |

Turning paid capacity **on** therefore needs two admin actions: a runner variable
pointing at Warp *and* `CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW=1`. Turning it **off** needs
either — including a pull request anyone with push access can merge. Between
2026-09-19 and 2026-09-23 these four variables, plus the former release-specific
runner variable now folded into `MACOS_RUNNER_26`, pointed at Warp, so main and
the merge queue ran metered while pull requests ran free.

`MACOS_RUNNER_26` stays ungated because it names the ordinary free macOS 26
pool used by several jobs. Its safety check is the value policy described above.
Moving `release-build` onto a paid pool therefore takes one admin action:
repointing `MACOS_RUNNER_26`.

`tests/test_ci_repo_variable_defaults.py` fails if a workflow reads one of the
four paid-overflow variables without the gate, and
`scripts/ci/ci_health_report.py` reports how many metered runner minutes each
window actually contained.

```bash
gh variable set CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b 1   # enable paid overflow
gh variable delete CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW --repo manaflow-ai/cmux     # back to free capacity
```

```bash
gh variable set LINUX_RUNNER          --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404
gh variable set LINUX_ARM64_RUNNER    --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b ubuntu-24.04-arm
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_15         --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_DUAL_XCODE --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_26         --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_26_LARGE   --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_DISPLAY    --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_IOS        --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26
```

Leave `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` and `MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` unset in either recipe.
They exist to hold the pull-request and manual test lanes on Blacksmith
independently of whatever the pool above is set to.

Restore the self-hosted pool with explicit labels. The gate above applies
here too: `MACOS_RUNNER_15`, `MACOS_RUNNER_DISPLAY` and the other gated
variables are read only when `CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW=1`, so Tart needs that
flag set even though Tart is free. Without it, these values are ignored and
every lane stays on its Blacksmith fallback, with no error. `MACOS_RUNNER_26`
is ungated, so repointing the ordinary macOS 26 pool does not require the paid
overflow switch.

```bash
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_15         --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b tart-macos-15
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_DUAL_XCODE --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_26         --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_26_LARGE   --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_DISPLAY    --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b tart-gui
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_IOS        --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b tart-ios
```

`MACOS_RUNNER_DUAL_XCODE` remains on Blacksmith because the Tart macOS 15
image currently carries Xcode 26 only and cannot build the SDK 15 helper.

Check current values:

```bash
gh variable list --repo manaflow-ai/cmux
```

## Manual runs

`perf-activation.yml` and `test-e2e.yml` keep a `runner` choice input that
defaults to `auto`. Manual `auto` runs follow `MACOS_RUNNER_15` then the Blacksmith
fallback, so flipping the repo variable redirects those workflows. An explicit
manual choice wins over the variable; both dropdowns expose Blacksmith, Warp,
and `depot-macos-*` choices, with a Depot identity guard for GUI-activation
runs. `test-e2e.yml` also exposes `tart-canary`, `tart-dual`, and `tart-small`
for targeted fleet validation. These choices are available only through
`workflow_dispatch`.

## Guard

`tests/test_ci_self_hosted_guard.sh` (run by the `workflow-guard-tests` job)
asserts that no job pins a bare GitHub-hosted runner (`ubuntu-*` / `macos-NN`):
every job must route through a runner repo variable so the overflow switch stays
a single variable flip. A GitHub-hosted macOS label may appear only as the
`MACOS_RUNNER_BACKGROUND` fallback (`vars.MACOS_RUNNER_BACKGROUND || 'macos-15'`)
in a workflow with no pull request, merge-queue or `workflow_call` trigger,
apart from the pinned macOS 14 / Intel compatibility legs in
`ci-macos-compat.yml` and `relay-publish-npm.yml`. It also asserts every paid macOS job references
`vars.MACOS_RUNNER_*` or a Blacksmith/Warp/Depot label so it can never silently
fall back to a free runner. Bare third-party provider labels (`blacksmith-*`, `warp-*`,
`depot-*`) stay allowed for deliberate single-runner pins. "Paid" there means
"not a GitHub-hosted free runner"; of the three, only Warp and Depot bill this
repository per minute, since Blacksmith is sponsored for this organization.
The CI health report counts those two. Keep new labels in
`.github/actionlint.yaml`.

The fleet-label guard allows Tart labels only as exact manual canary choices.
Required jobs continue to reference repository variables, so cutover and
break-glass remain configuration changes instead of workflow edits.

## CMUX-owned machine enrollment

Persistent CMUX hardware can be enrolled for repository-owned semantic workloads without becoming a direct required-CI runner. See [fleet-enrollment.md](fleet-enrollment.md).

The first reviewed role bindings are:

- `cmux_macos_native_build -> cmux.macos.dev-check@1`
- `cmux_linux_ci -> cmux.ci.guard@1`

CMUX owns those workload profiles and their pass/fail semantics through `scripts/ci/cmux_workload_profile.py`. Glaeda owns the machine enrollment record, candidate eligibility, local admission, and acceptance receipt that binds the exact canonical `cmux-workload-result/v1` bytes.

Enrollment does not register a GitHub runner or change repository runner variables. Required CI continues to use the policy above until a separately reviewed CI routing change promotes a fleet role.

## Direct physical-host runner boundary

Required GUI, test, Release, signing, and ordinary macOS jobs never route to
the persistent self-hosted mac-mini fleet (`cmux-mac-mini`, `studio1`,
`mac4-cmuxvnc*`, `cmux-austin-mini-*`). Those records can collide with cloud
labels and lack the isolated foreground GUI guarantees expected by runtime
tests.

The sole direct-host exception is the dispatch-only
`Persistent Apple compile` producer described above, selected by its dedicated
workflow-restricted `cmux-persistent-compile` runner group and
`cmux-persistent-macos-compile` label. It performs compile-only Debug work,
carries no repository secrets, and grants its hot state zero result authority.
The second is the dispatch-only nightly producer (`nightly-mini-build.yml`,
`cmux-nightly-mini` group, `cmux-nightly-mini-build` label), which compiles the
unsigned nightly app for a hosted job that revalidates and signs it; see
[mac-fleet.md, Nightly lane](ci/mac-fleet.md#nightly-lane).
Every required macOS fallback still routes to the paid hosted path.
`check_no_self_hosted_fleet_runners` in
`tests/test_ci_self_hosted_guard.sh` enforces that exact exception and rejects
any second required-job or generic fleet route. Repository variables may keep
pointing at the isolated `tart-*` pool for their existing jobs.
